Object Oriented Programming is a programming design paradigm in which code
architectures are based on the concept of "objects". It give codes a structure,
encapsulated into _classes_ and treated as an independent, inheritable, and
extendable entity, similar to how we humans structure our everyday life.

OO design principles relies on its four pillars: Encapsulation, Abstraction,
Polymorphism, and Inheritance.

For instance, a code implementation for storing different classifications of
musical instruments. A family of String instruments are encapsulated by
`StringInstrument` class where `Guitar`, `Violin`, or `Cello` classes inherits
from. Similarly, `PercussionInstrument` class parents the subclasses `Drums`,
`Marimba`, or `Tambourine`.
