Professor Brian Little, a renowned Former Harvard University Lecturer, calls the
things we value and love the most our core personal projects. In Little's
#[[1ba9c585|Free-Trait Theory]], it suggests that we are born with absolute
temperament or fixed traits and we are only able to break out of character if we
work towards a core personal project.

Core personal projects, according to Little, dramatically improve our lives when
we consider it meaningful, manageable, enjoyable, and supported by others. Often
times, we give great emotional weight to our core personal projects that when
asked "How things are going?" we may respond with a rehearsed answer, but our
true response relates to how well stand we it.

Finding your core personal projects can be quite difficult especially for
[[f716779e|introverts who have been living under extroverted ideals]]. Susan
Cain, in her book[^1], offers 3 steps on finding your own core personal
projects:

1. Think back to what you loved doing as a child. How did you answer what you
   want to be when you grew up? Our unadulterated childhood may reveal our true
   desire.
2. Pay attention to the work you gravitate to. You may not like what you do with
   your current job, but we often do things as a means to our goal.
3. Pay attention to what you envy. "Jealousy is an ugly emotion, but it tells
   the truth." We desire the things we are envious of which may give away a hint
   to a suitable core personal project.

  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p>
    Our core personal projects are the things we value and love the most. It
    improve our lives significantly and give great emotional weight to it.
    Free-Trait theory suggests we are only able to pretend someone we are not if
    we work towards a core personal project.
