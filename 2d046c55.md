Professor Brian Little, a renowned Former Harvard University Lecturer, call the
things we value and love the most our core personal projects. In Little's
#[[1ba9c585|Free-Trait Theory]], it suggests that we are born with absolute
cultural personality traits and were only able to act out of it if we work
towards core personal projects.

Core personal projects, according to Little, dramatically improve our lives when
we consider it meaningful, manageable, unduly stressful, and supported by
others. Often times, we give great emotional weight to our core personal
projects that when asked "How things are going?" we may respond with a rehearsed
answer, but our true response relates to how well stand we it.

Professor Little, a high #[[2b25093b|self-monitor]], a consummate introvert who
loves his students dearly, is only able to break out of character and
passionately lecture like a performer because of his core personal projects:
opening students' mind and attending to their well-being.

Finding your core personal projects can be quite difficult especially for
[[f716779e|introverts who have been living under extroverted ideals]]. Susan
Cain, in her book[^1], offers 3 steps on finding your own core personal
projects:

1. Think back to what you loved doing as a child. How did you answer what you
   want to be when you grew up? Our unadulterated childhood whims may reveal our
   true desire.
2. Pay attention to the work you gravitate to. You may not like what you do with
   your current job, but we often do things as a means to our goal.
3. Finally, pay attention to what you envy. "Jealousy is an ugly emotion, but it
   tells the truth." We desire the things we are envious of which may give away
   a hint to a suitable core personal project.

  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p>
    Our core personal projects are the things we value and love the most. It
    improve our lives significantly and give great emotional weight to it.
    Free-Trait theory suggests we are only able to pretend someone we are not if
    we work towards a core personal project.
