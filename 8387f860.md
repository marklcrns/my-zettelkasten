The laws of science, tested and proven for centuries before our time, is true
throughout the universe. The laws of physics, the speed of light, gravity or
"the big G", are some of the languages our universe speaks. All the living and
non-living objects, matters and anti-matters, are subject to these laws that can
never be broken. Science is the language of the universe. It is the universal
law.
