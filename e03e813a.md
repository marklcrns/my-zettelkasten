By nature, introverts are analytical and introspective people who "wait before
pouncing" at every possible opportunity. On the other hand, extroverts are risk
takers and #[[c52d5fa7|reward-sensitive]] people who "act before thinking" to
get where they want to be as quickly as possible. Of course, not everyone falls
solely on either side of the spectrum. Some are partial to both categories while
others lie smack dab in the middle. However, despite the
[[152e55d5|temperamental]] difference between the two
[[0ad97bc4|personality traits]], neither has superior intellect over the other.

Statistically speaking, according to IQ scores, the two types are equally
intelligent. As the psychologist Gerald Matthews describes in his work,
introverts think more carefully than extroverts. Extroverts approach
problem-solving head-on, taking shortcuts along the way, trading accuracy for
speed which makes it easier to commit mistakes, and giving up altogether when
the task gets overwhelmingly frustrating. Conversely, introverts digest
information thoroughly, better at #[[f2ab6c67|delaying gratification]], takes
more preparation than extroverts do which makes it easier to stick with problems
longer.[^1]

Wise words from the world-renowned genius theoretical physicist, Albert
Einstein: "It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems
longer."

    intellect. The difference lie only on temperament.
