Often times, #[[df8128c0]] by replacing existing habits with an alternative
routine isn't enough to permanently change your behavior. As proven countless of
times, under duress, we are likely to relapse to our old habits and all our
progressive efforts to change will all be for nothing.

Researchers have found that changing one's habit is just half the battle,
believing is the other. One reasons why AA meetings are so effective is that it
harbors a community of believers who have somehow been in similar situation as
the ones within their group. A person named John from the book, _The Power of
Habit_, an alcoholic who was sober for two years after he got in a car accident
that led to a broken arm of his son, relapsed after founding out that his mom
got cancer. He then went back to his old drinking habits and found new
destructive ones, such as cocaine. He was an atheist and was always skeptical
whenever a fellow addict mentions God as their savior. Likewise, researchers
hated an untestable hypothesis for the belief of a non-existent God. Rather,
they found that believing in something, especially in groups, increases the
chances to solidify habitual change, permanently. "If it can work for that guy,
I guess it can work for me too" (The Power of Habit, ch 3).

Another example. NFL Head coach of Colts, Tony Dungy, who used to coach Tampa
Bay Buccaneers, trained Colts' players with the same approach he employed in his
previous team. To rewire their habits and drill fundamentals into them until it
becomes automatic reaction. He believes that it is not necessary to have the
thickest playbook to win the Super Bowl, rather, to eliminate hesitations in
crucial times and to quickly react in such moments as if they are born to do so.
The Colts' had won consecutively, their best record yet, proving the skills of
Dungy as a coach and his methods. However, whenever Colts are up against a huge
hurdle they never before overcome, their play crumbles, always resulting to
a devastating game. They over think and hesitate, too a slow to make decisions
as if they suddenly forgot all their training.

Why do we relapse or crumble at the face of adversity, after what all we've
accomplished so far in changing our habits? Why do alcoholics, who's been sober
for years go back to drinking after a hearing a devastating news, or choke every
time you fought your greatest hurdles? Old habits are never forgotten, but can
be overridden with a new routine. But all of that can be reinforced with
a belief system. Belief that everything will be alright in the end and belief
in the process you are in. And that belief comes organically in a community of
people who believe in the cause and a successful outcome as you are.

John, from the first example, after getting divorced and almost killing himself
and arrested for DUI, attends AA meetings and is now sober for more than 7 years
at the time. Coach Dungy lost his son Jamie after committing suicide recovered
from the traumatic tragedy with his team that lit a fire in their hearts to
believe in their coach and in the system. They won against the divisional title
holders, Patriots, and won the Super Bowl in 2007.
