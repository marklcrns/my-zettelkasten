Studies have found that introverts and extroverts can play the role of the
other, but only to some extent. #[[1ba9c585]] suggests that we are capable of
acting out of our "fixed traits" and self-represent ourselves for the things we
deem important or valuable--our [[2d046c55]]--which enhances our
lives dramatically.

Behavioral leakage is a phenomenon in which our role playing, typically when an
introvert acts extroverted or vice versa, abruptly break out of character
showing his/her true self through unconscious body language. It is when you
caught your seemingly extroverted professor suddenly look away to avoid eye
contact or placed the burden of speaking on a student when he could've held the
floor a little longer.
