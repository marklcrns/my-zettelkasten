Studies have found that introverts and extroverts can play the role of the
other, but only to some extent. #[[1ba9c585]] suggests that we are capable of
acting out of our "fixed traits" and self-represent ourselves for the things we
deem important or valuable--our [[2d046c55]]--which enhances our
lives dramatically.

Behavioral leakage is a phenomenon in which our role playing, typically when an
introvert acts extroverted or vice versa, abruptly break out of character
showing his/her true self through unconcious body language. It is when you
caught your seemingly extroverted professor suddenly look away to avoid eye
contact or placed the the burden of speaking on a student when he could've held
the floor a little longer.
