In the parlance of economics, perfect information (AKA "no hidden information")
is a feature of perfect competition where the consumer and producers have the
same instantaneous knowledge of crucial market information at any given time.

While in #[[c5724d4a|Game Theory]], a sequential game is considered perfect
information (not to be confused with [[7607687c|Complete information]]) if each
player are perfectly informed of all the events that have occurred or is
occuring, e.g. chess.

On the other hand, a situation where some events are not available to other
participants is an example of an **imperfect information** game, e.g. poker.
