Everyday, we are faced with multitude of decision making whether to stay with
the tradition or venture novelty. Do we buy our favorite flavor of snack that we
know for sure we'll enjoy, or do we try something new, knowing it might be our
best yet flavor or the worst one. We were always reminded to "always try
something new" or to "try new things" but we were never told by how much.
Computer scientist have been trying to find the perfect balance between the two
for more than fifty years, they even have a name for it: the explore/exploit
tradeoff.
