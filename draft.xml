Our brain processes multiple information from different our basic senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see through our eyes, hear through our ears, or feel with our skin. We make sense of the world using our basic survival skills, but often times, it is an impediment to our learning. A psychologist at the University of Western Ontario came up with a solution as to why some eyewitnesses remembered better than others. After watching overwhelming amount of questioning footages, she figured out a pattern by focusing on few important elements at a time: the questioner‚Äôs tone, the facial expression of the witness, how close the questioner and the witness were sitting to each other. [^1]. To isolate the questioner‚Äôs tone, she turned down the volume until all she can hear was the tone of their voices. To focus on the facial expression of the witness, she taped the questioners face. To measure their distance, she used a tape measure onto the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later on, it came to her that most eyewitnesses who were questioned by cops in a gentle manner tend to misremember what happened to the incident. ‚ÄúIn other words, when environmental cue said ‚Äòwe are friends‚Äô‚Äìa gentle tone, smiling face‚Äì ‚Ä¶Subconsciously those friendship cues triggered a habit to please the questioner.‚Äù [^1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can apply the lesson from the story by isolating the important elements that may cause our habits to be triggered, one at a time. Experiment have show that almost all habitual cues fit into one of five categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-none&#34;&gt;Location
Time
Emotional State
Other people
Immediately preceding action&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment your urge hits, write down five things following the five categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, having the urge to drive by fast-food restaurant:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-none&#34;&gt;Location:                     Driving home on the free way
Time:                         3:36pm (after work)
Emotional State:              Lethargic
Other People:                 None
Immediately preceding action: Getting in the car&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-none&#34;&gt;Location:                     Driving home on the free way
Time:                         3:46pm (after work)
Emotional State:              Stressed
Other People:                 None
Immediately preceding action: Getting in the car&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;After working out:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-none&#34;&gt;Location:                     Driving home from the gym
Time:                         5:33pm
Emotional State:              Burned out
Other People:                 None
Immediately preceding action: Getting in the car&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so on‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have enough information to ascertain that a pattern emerge‚Äìlike driving home after a stressful activity‚Äì, you are one step closer to changing your habit. Figuring out your habit‚Äôs routine, reward, and cue is &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Small Wins&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;small-wins&#34;&gt;no trivial feat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and you should be proud of yourself. However, there is one final, and probably the most important one: &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folge&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;2021-08-23T07:42&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;step-four-have-a-plan&#34;&gt;Step Four: Have a Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;[^1] &lt;em&gt;The Power of Habit&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Duhigg: Appendix: A Reader‚Äôs Guide to Using These Ideas&lt;/p&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/step-three-isolate-the-cue"/></entry></feed>
