It is when you caught your seemingly extroverted professor suddenly look away to avoid eye contact or placed the the burden of speaking on a student when he could’ve held the floor a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/behavioral-leakage"/></entry><entry><id>https://marklucernas.dev/struggles-of-the-introverts-in-an-extroverted-society</id><title type="text">Struggles of the Introverts in an Extroverted Society</title><updated>2021-08-31T07:22</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the commercial TV ads, to our school system and to workplaces, our society have always favored forwardness, spontaneity and the hail-fellow-well-met who put themselves out in the world. While the more reserved individuals shy away of their talents and overlooked at opportunities they would’ve had had they been more “enthusiastic”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parenting in 1950s believe that children who are quiet and solitary are unacceptable and that gregariousness are ideal for both genders. The quiet kids were singled-out as problem cases in school and were shunned for their solitary and serious demeanor. The parents of these introverted children means well for and were only preparing their kids for higher education and the “real world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the late 1940s, Harvard’s provost Paul Buck declared that “Harvard should reject the ‘sensitive, neurotic’ type and the intellectually over-stimulated’ in favor of boys of the ’healthy extrovert kind” wrote, Susan Cain&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. 1950 Yale’s president, Alfred Whitney Griswold, stated that Yalie was not a “beetle-browed, highly specialized intellectual, but a well-rounded man.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shy types are considered a maladjusted people. The latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) considers &lt;strong&gt;Glossophobia&lt;/strong&gt;–fear of public speaking–to be a disease if it interferes with the job performance of the sufferer. “It’s not enough to be able to sit at your computer excited about a fantastic regression analysis if you’re squeamish about presenting those results to an executive group”, said one senior manager at Eastman Kodak. Ironically, its OK to be squeamish about doing regression analysis if you are excited about giving speeches, as Cain pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introverts have always been unfairly treated for their “unenthusiastic energy” or that introversion are often seen in a negative light.

It’s only natural that we require these traits from a good leader as our society &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Struggles of the Introverts in an Extroverted Society&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;struggles-of-the-introverts-in-an-extroverted-society&#34;&gt;leans toward extroverted ideals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. We strive to be the Steve Jobs or Captain America of the world and less like Mahatma Ghandi or Rosa Parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research from a management professor at Wharton who consulted Fortune 500 executives and military leaders, Adam Grant, dug deeper into the correlation between extroversion and leadership and found that the existing research failed to differentiate among situations what leaders might face. Grant noticed that existing studies focused more on what our perception of a good leader rooting from our societal ideals rather than the actual result. Grant believes that certain organization or context calls for an introverted leadership rather than an extroverted approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His hypothesis was that extroverted leaders are better suited to lead passive followers, and introverted leaders are more effective with proactive team. “Introverts are uniquely good at leading initiative-takers. Because of their inclination to listen to others and lack of interest in dominating social situations”, says Adam Grant, “…Having benefited from the talents of their followers, they are likely to motivate them to be even more proactive.” On the other hand, extroverts “can be so intent on putting their own stamp on events that they risk losing others’ good ideas along the way and allowing [followers] to lapse into passivity&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;”, wrote Susan Cain. However, extrovert’s natural ability to inspire are more effective on getting things done form passive followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Grant’s research suggest that introverted leaders are well suited to just stick with what they do naturally and should not be construed as anything less of a what we think a leader should be. In contrast, extroverts “may wish to adopt a more reserved, quiet style,” Grant writes, and should learn to listen more to give the quite-oriented the chance to speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking - Chapter 2: The Myth of Charismatic Leadership&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/extrovert-vs-introvert-leadership"/></entry></feed>
