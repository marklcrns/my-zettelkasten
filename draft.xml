Or, on the other hand, does our personality traits shift according to the situation in which we find ourselves in? Perhaps quiet around family members and a comic with the company of friends? Psychologist call this the “person-situation” debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Brian Little, former Harvard University psychology lecturer and winner for the 3M Teaching Fellowship, despite his brilliant and engaging lectures with a flair for entertainment that always ended with a hearty applause, he calls himself a devout introvert. Professor Little believes that our personality shape our lives in profound ways based on psychological mechanisms that last our lifetime. This fall squarely on the “person” side of the debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side, a group of psychologist known as the &lt;em&gt;Situationist&lt;/em&gt;. “Situationism posits that our generalizations about people, including the words we use to describe one another–shy, agressive, conscientious, agreeable–are misleading. There is no core self; there are only the various selves of Situations X, Y, Z,” wrote Susan Cain.&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &#34;A man has as many social selves as there are distinct groups of persons
    about whose opinion he cares. He generally shows a different side of himself
    to each of these different groups.&#34;
    - William James
