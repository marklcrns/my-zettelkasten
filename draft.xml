It is when you caught your seemingly extroverted professor suddenly look away to avoid eye contact or placed the the burden of speaking on a student when he could’ve held the floor a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/behavioral-leakage"/></entry><entry><id>https://marklucernas.dev/struggles-of-the-introverts-in-an-extroverted-society</id><title type="text">Struggles of the Introverts in an Extroverted Society</title><updated>2021-08-31T07:22</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the commercial TV ads, to our school system and to workplaces, our society have always favored forwardness, spontaneity and the hail-fellow-well-met who put themselves out in the world. While the more reserved individuals shy away of their talents and overlooked at opportunities they would’ve had had they been more “enthusiastic”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parenting in 1950s believe that children who are quiet and solitary are unacceptable and that gregariousness are ideal for both genders. The quiet kids were singled-out as problem cases in school and were shunned for their solitary and serious demeanor. The parents of these introverted children means well for and were only preparing their kids for higher education and the “real world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, in the late 1940s, Harvard’s provost Paul Buck declared that “Harvard should reject the ‘sensitive, neurotic’ type and the intellectually over-stimulated’ in favor of boys of the ’healthy extrovert kind” wrote, Susan Cain&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. 1950 Yale’s president, Alfred Whitney Griswold, stated that Yalie was not a “beetle-browed, highly specialized intellectual, but a well-rounded man.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shy types are considered a maladjusted people. The latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) considers &lt;strong&gt;Glossophobia&lt;/strong&gt;–fear of public speaking–to be a disease if it interferes with the job performance of the sufferer. “It’s not enough to be able to sit at your computer excited about a fantastic regression analysis if you’re squeamish about presenting those results to an executive group”, said one senior manager at Eastman Kodak. Ironically, its OK to be squeamish about doing regression analysis if you are excited about giving speeches, as Cain pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introverts have always been unfairly treated for their “unenthusiastic energy” or that introversion are often seen in a negative light.
