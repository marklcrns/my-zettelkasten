It is when you caught your seemingly extroverted professor suddenly look away to avoid eye contact or placed the the burden of speaking on a student when he could’ve held the floor a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/behavioral-leakage"/></entry><entry><id>https://marklucernas.dev/temperament</id><title type="text">Temperament</title><updated>2021-09-06T06:24</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;“Psychologists often discuss the difference between ‘temperament’ and ‘personality.’ Temperament refers to inborn, biologically based behavioral and emotional patterns that are observable in infancy and early childhood; personality is the complex brew that emerges after cultural influence and personal experience are thrown into the mix.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerome Kagan, one of the great developmental psychologists of the twentieth century, conducted a study on five hundred four-month-old infants for Child Development at Harvard, predicting, on the strength of forty-five-minute evaluation, which babies were more likely to turn into introverts or extroverts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Kagan’s studies found that &lt;strong&gt;high-reactive&lt;/strong&gt; children grow up to be introverts who avoids risk and are in comfortable in their own self-controlled environment, while &lt;strong&gt;low-reactive&lt;/strong&gt; children becomes extroverted adults who are risk takers and outgoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High- and low-reactive infants seems to be the opposite of what we expect from what an introvert and extrovert adult act like. High-reactive infants are those who react more robustly to new stimuli such as ballon popping, colorful visuals, or music. On the other hand, low-reactive ones are those infants who does the opposite and remain calm and quiet to new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/temperament"/></entry></feed>
