Stimulation is the input from the outside world that our brain processes. Eysenck also saw the connection between the &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: The Great Divide in Personality&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;the-great-divide-of-personality&#34;&gt;two great personality trait&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and level of stimulation: introverts find it optimally stimulating when they work alone in a quiet place, while the party-seeking extroverts chase more stimulations and can be seen more often socializing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Eysenck believes that the difference between two personality traits can be found in our &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS)&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;ascending-reticular-activating-system&#34;&gt;Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, part of our brainstem that has ascending pathways to the &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container cf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Cerebral Cortex&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;cerebral-cortex&#34;&gt;cortex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and other parts of the brain which contribute to our wakefulness and behavioral arousal. Eysenck speculated that ARAS maintains the balance between over- and under-arousal by controlling the amount of stimulation that goes into our brain: introverts have wide open channels where excessive stimulation can flow, causing them to feel overwhelmed, while extroverts have narrower channels that restrict some stimulations. ‚ÄúOver-arousal doesn‚Äôt produce anxiety so much as the sense that you can‚Äôt think strait‚Äìthat you‚Äôve had enough and would like to go home now. Under-arousal is something like cabin fever. Not enough is happening: you feel itchy, restless, and sluggish, like you need to get out of the house already,‚Äù wrote Susan Cain&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the underlying difference between introversion and extroversion, we can arrive to a solution, in parlance of personality psychologists, the ‚Äúoptimal levels of arousal‚Äù, or as Cain puts it, ‚Äúsweet spots.‚Äù An introvert in an overstimulating party with excessive amount of socializing may feel overwhelmed and seek some place less stimulating, or the sweet spot. Conversely, an introvert reading within the confines of the study room found him/herself to be reading at a lower rate of speed and have been reading few sentences multiple times may feel like getting out and hanging out with friends. Again, the sweet spot or just the right amount of stimulation. The opposite can also be true for extroverts who gets bored easily and find the company of others to be their sweet spot, while being alone to be under-stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to get into our optimal levels of arousal can greatly improve our lifestyle. People who are aware of their sweet spots have the understanding to decide whether to stay in their current employment or start their own business. Also, evidence shows that sweet spots can have life-or-death consequences. Recent study at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research suggests that introverts function better then extroverts when sleep deprived, which is cortically de-arousing condition. Drowsy extroverts behind the wheel may feel less alert and careful with their surroundings. Conversely, introverts in a loud and noisy traffic may feel overwhelmed which could potentially impair their thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can‚Äôt Stop Talking by Susan Cain - Chapter 5: Beyond Temperament&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/optimal-levels-of-stimulation"/></entry></feed>
