Willpower is the amount of persistence and determination each of us have to
complete a task or keep on going despite of unpleasant circumstances.
Researchers from University of Pennsilvania have found that students with more
willpower and self-discipline perform better at school and get higher grades
than those students with higher IQ but with less willpower. They watch less TV,
spend more hours doing homework and generally outperform their more impulsive
peers.

However, willpower, just as #[[3160db60]], crumbles in the face of adversity.
No matter how much willpower a person has, at an _inflection point_--a highly
stressful or provoking event--they freeze or loose their composure.
A salesperson who studied and memorsized the products he/she is selling,
memorized the script, and trained to respond to certain cues, would freeze as
soon as he/she encounter an angry customer. The solution to this, as the book,
_The Power of Habit_ suggests, is to envision yourself going through the
inflection point and write down the specific details you would do come the
event. Also, willpower is required in a #[[df8128c0]] and establish
#[[2b01515b]].

A group of psychology PhD at Case Western conducted a study on willpower. They
measured the capacity of willpower a person have after experiencing something
unpleasant versus experienceing something pleasurable--eating cookies vs
raddishes. The result was, people who eat cookes exerted more willpower trying
to solve an impossible puzzle and those who ate raddishes gave up quicker that
the other group. It goes to show that will power is a scarce resource that need
to be spent wisely. A person who goes to the gym in the morning will have more
determination to lift heavier than if he would go at night after
a willpower-consuming work.
