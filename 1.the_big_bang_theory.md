# The Big Bang Theory

In the beginning, the universe was hot and expanding, and was a mere cauldron
cooking matter-antimatter pairs in a battle for survival. Clashing against each
other, as matter creates, antimatter annihilates. As the universe began to
cool, matters very subtly outweighted antimatter leading to the creation of the
the universe as we know it. All this happend under $10^{-43}$ second of time.
Billion years later when the universe was cool enough, stars were formed and
underwent thermonuclear fusion. Some thrived but some exploded due to high-mass,
scattering their chemically rich bodies across the universe. Consequently,
galaxies, the Milky Way, and the Sun were born. The gas clouds from which the
Sun was created, formed planets that orbits around the Sun. Earth, not too far
away and not too close from the Sun to freeze or to evaporate the ocean,
produced life in its primordial form. Bacteria. These anaerobic organisms sets
the Earth's environment by excreting enough oxygen for aerobic organisms to live
and breath in, and dominate the ocean and the surface of the earth. Life began.
Outsized dinosours dominate. Asteroids hit the earth. Intelligent mammals
thrived. Homo Sapiens ruled.
