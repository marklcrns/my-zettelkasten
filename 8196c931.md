Trade-off theory suggests that everything good comes at a price and everything
seemingly bad has unapparent benefits.

As with the perpetual discussion between extroverts vs introverts, being an
extrovert isn't always as favorable being gregarious as is being an introverts
isn't always advantageous being analytical. The opposite is also true.

For instance, human extroverts have more sexual partners than their introverted
peers but they are more likely to commit adultery and get divorced. Also,
extroverts are more athletic exercise regularly, but introverts suffer less
injuries. Extroverts are better at socializing and have wider network of social
support, but commit more crimes in general.[^1]
