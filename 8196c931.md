Trade-off theory suggests that everything comes at a price. Being an extrovert
isn't always as favorable being gregarious as is being an introverts isn't
always advantageous being analytical.

For instance, human extroverts have more sexual partners than their introverted
peers but they are more likely to commit adultery and to get divorced. Also,
extroverts are more athletic and exercise regularly, but introverts suffer less
injuries. Extroverts are better at socializing and have wider network of social
support, but commit more crimes in general.
