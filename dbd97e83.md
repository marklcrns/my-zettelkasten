Craving makes us want something so badly to the effect that we feel
disappointment or dissatisfaction the longer our cravings remain unfulfilled. We
crave because of the anticipation of the reward, then to feel pleasure once the
craving is satisfied.

Also, craving helps create #[[b11c411a]]. Ever wonder why some of our plan to
build a habit we always end up breaking them altogether? Researchers from MIT
have found that in order to build a habit, you have to reinforce a craving. For
us to keep within the #[[7cf59f2b]], we have to have a cue to crave for the
reward. We brush our teeth and feel that tingling sensation afterwards, cueing
us that our mouth is clean. Pepsodent adds citric acid and mint in its formula
to generate that cool sensation, however unnecessary to cleanse our mouth. It
reminds us that the toothpaste is working, and we crave for it. Many toothpaste
brands that predates Pepsodent have failed to make people form the habit to
regularly brush their teeth because the craving is missing, therefore people
forget or sometimes refuse out of laziness.
