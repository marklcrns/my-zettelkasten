One of the main reason why #[[2b01515b]] can potentially change the behavior of
one person drastically over time, is because of what psychologists call "small
wins". Small wins are the little accomplishments, or subtasks that do to
complete our main goal. As a prominent organizational psychologists puts it Karl
Weick,"Small wins do not combine a neat, linear, serial form, with each step
being demonstrable step closer to some predefined goal."

When changing one's habit, more often than not, forceful dramatic changes in
one's behavior ends up failing. Initially, it might work because of sudden
inspiration to change or a burst of drive cause by an event that fuels the
initiative to change. But that drive can only get you so far and most people
eventually stop doing the routine due to strenuous, high standard tasks they put
themselves into. Studies have found, obese individuals, after a drastic
lifestyle change, becomes overwhelmed and goes back to their old habits and give
up eventually. Smokers relapse after going "cold turkey" for a long period of
time, only building up the urge to smoke once more, then finding themselves
holding a cigarette opening up Pandora's box of their old addictive habit.

Small wins, however little, incites the feeling of accomplishment and thus
encouraging to move forward onto the next one without the burden of shock.
Making your bed neatly every morning when you wake up might not be so rewarding
but it encourages another task to be done. These small wins slowly builds
a culture around yourself that is contagious, inspiring like-minded around you
which can lead to a community that supports each other for the cause.

If we want to achieve something big, we start with the smallest of tasks and
work our way up to our ultimate goal. Change happen in increments. Not by sudden
revolution.
