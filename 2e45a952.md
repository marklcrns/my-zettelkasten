Interactive Directed graph of my Zettelkasten database made with [D3.js].

``` {=html}
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v6.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./static/graph.css">
<script src="./static/graph.js" type="module"></script>
```

> Drag to pin a node. Ctrl + Click to unpin a node. Double click node to view
> note. Nodes are colored and sized based on incoming degree, so notes more
> heavily linked to will grow in relative size.

All Credits goes to [Devon Morris]'s [Zettelkasten] for his static files on this
awesome [D3.js] graph.
