The tricky thing about #[[df8128c0]] is that there is no single blanket formula
that can change any habit we want to change. If its that easy, then we should
all be the best version of our selves as we speak, right?

Changing a habit is very personal and unique to our needs and experiences. Bad
habit of drinking alcohol under stressful events needs different approach than
a habit of drinking out of boredom. Therefore, personal predicament calls for
personal habit changing formula.

However, there is a framework that we can follow to diagnose our own habits and
to help us strategically attack those habits while minimizing relapses[^1].

### The Framework

- [[66362667]]# (why)
- [[b8010b9f]]# (what)
- [[bb63ba32]]#

The best way to go through these steps is to read the next one only when you are
done with the previous step. It will help you focus and really absorb what each
step is meant for as it is important not rush this over. This is already
a shortcut so don't cut it short still.
