Dr. Carl Schwartz, director of the Developmental Neuroimaging and
Psychopathology Research Lab, is Jerome Kagan's colleague and protégé whose work
picks up just where Kagan's longitudinal studies of personality left off.
Schwartz believe that our amygdala, part of our brains that processes emotions,
play an important role in shaping some introverts' and extroverts'
personalities.

- When our amygdala process fear, our frontal cortex, responsible of our
  decision making, tells it to calm down. Its the reason why repetition is
  effective to lessen our fear. But when our frontal cortex is overwhelmed, our
  fear takes over.
- "rubber band theory" of personality pg.118[^1]
