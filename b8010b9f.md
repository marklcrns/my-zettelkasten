After #[[66362667|figuring out the "why" (reward) to your habit]], it is time to
find the _what_ or the cue to your persisting habit.

Most of the time, the cue to our habit is very simple but is often overlooked.
Our brain processes multiple inputs simultaneously from our basic senses.

We see through our eyes, hear through our ears, or feel with our skin. We make
sense of the world with our basic survival skills. But often times, it is also
an impediment to our learning. A psychologist at the University of Western
Ontario came up with a solution as to why some eyewitnesses remembered better
than others[^1]. After watching overwhelming amount of questioning footages, she
figured out a pattern by focusing on few important elements at a time: the
questioner's tone, the facial expression of the witness, how close the
questioner and the witness were sitting to each other.

To isolate the questioner's tone, she turned down the volume until all she can
hear was the tone of their voices. To focus on the facial expression of the
witness, she taped the questioners face. To measure their distance, she used
a tape measure onto the screen.

Later on, it came to her that most eyewitnesses who were questioned by cops in
a gentle manner tend to misremember what happened to the incident. "In other
words, when environmental cue said 'we are friends'--a gentle tone, smiling
face-- ...Subconsciously those friendship cues triggered a habit to please the
questioner."

The takeaway from the questioner-eyewitness experiment is to separate the
important elements from the rest to figure out the underlying pattern. We can
apply this by isolating only the key elements that may cause our habit to be
triggered. Experiments have shown that almost all habitual cues fit into one of
five categories:

- Location
- Time
- Emotional State
- Other people
- Immediately preceding action

There are many indicators that can help identify the cause of a habit. However,
these categories are exceptional indicators. For example, a habit of eating at
a fast-food restaurant every time you hop in your car. Your notes may look like:

    Location:                     Driving home on the free way
    Time:                         3:36pm (after work)
    Emotional State:              Lethargic
    Other People:                 None
    Immediately preceding action: Getting in the car


Next day:

    Location:                     Driving home on the free way
    Time:                         3:46pm (after work)
    Emotional State:              Stressed
    Other People:                 None
    Immediately preceding action: Getting in the car

After working out:

    Location:                     Driving home from the gym
    Time:                         5:33pm
    Emotional State:              Burned out
    Other People:                 None
    Immediately preceding action: Getting in the car

And so on...

These reports may indicate that you are likely cued by fatigue or stress and
possibly being tempted by the smell from the outside of fast-food restaurants as
you drive by. Or, the feeling of loneliness encourages you to eat unhealthy
foods.

Once you have enough information to ascertain that a pattern emerge--like
driving home after a stressful activity--, you are one step closer to changing
your habit. Figuring out your habit's routine, reward, and cue is of
[[1723e0ed|no trivial feat]] and that you should be proud of yourself. However,
there is one final, and probably the most important step: [[bb63ba32]]#
