After #[[66362667|knowing your "why" (reward)]], it is time to figure out your
habit's "what" or cue.

Most of the time, the cue to our habit is very simple but is often overlooked.
Our brain processes multiple information from our basic senses.

We see through our eyes, hear through our ears, or feel with our skin. We make
sense of the world using our basic survival skills. But often times, it is an
impediment to our learning. A psychologist at the University of Western Ontario
came up with a solution as to why some eyewitnesses remembered better than
others. After watching overwhelming amount of questioning footages, she figured
out a pattern by focusing on few important elements at a time: the questioner's
tone, the facial expression of the witness, how close the questioner and the
witness were sitting to each other. [^1].

To isolate the questioner's tone, she turned down the volume until all she can
hear was the tone of their voices. To focus on the facial expression of the
witness, she taped the questioners face. To measure their distance, she used
a tape measure onto the screen.

Later on, it came to her that most eyewitnesses who were questioned by cops in
a gentle manner tend to misremember what happened to the incident. "In other
words, when environmental cue said 'we are friends'--a gentle tone, smiling
face-- ...Subconsciously those friendship cues triggered a habit to please the
questioner." [^1]

We can apply the lesson from the story by isolating the important elements that
may cause our habits to be triggered, one at a time. Experiments have shown that
almost all habitual cues fit into one of five categories:

    Location
    Time
    Emotional State
    Other people
    Immediately preceding action

The moment your urge hits, write down five things following the five categories.

For example, having the urge to drive by fast-food restaurant:

    Location:                     Driving home on the free way
    Time:                         3:36pm (after work)
    Emotional State:              Lethargic
    Other People:                 None
    Immediately preceding action: Getting in the car


Next day:

    Location:                     Driving home on the free way
    Time:                         3:46pm (after work)
    Emotional State:              Stressed
    Other People:                 None
    Immediately preceding action: Getting in the car

After working out:

    Location:                     Driving home from the gym
    Time:                         5:33pm
    Emotional State:              Burned out
    Other People:                 None
    Immediately preceding action: Getting in the car

And so on...

Once you have enough information to ascertain that a pattern emerge--like
driving home after a stressful activity--, you are one step closer to changing
your habit. Figuring out your habit's routine, reward, and cue is of
[[1723e0ed|no trivial feat]] and that you should be proud of yourself. However,
there is one final, and probably the most important step: [[bb63ba32]]#
