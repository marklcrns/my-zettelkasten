Organizational habits are #[[b11c411a]] that are formed within a body of an
organization or company by the independent decisions of each member which can
either help keep the best interest of the company, or stir internecine war
within.

Organizational habits or "routines", as Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter,
authors of _An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change_, describes it, "creates
truces that allow work to get done" (The Power of Habit, ch.6). Without
routines, employees and executives of a company will compete against each other
in pursuit of self-interest, putting the company's wellfare in jeopardy. Also,
routines allow a company to streamline decision makings and create more
predictable results, that even when the VP suddenly quit, the company will still
be functional.
