Its amazing how our brain manages to process and store information that will be
recollected at the time we need them. Additionally, "chunking" our routine
activities into habits is astonishing, making way for more process intensive
tasks such as having a conversation while driving, or coming up with a maneuver
while guarding a basketball from an opponent[^1]. Having very little personal
knowledge about machine learning, I suppose, most of the functions of a neural
network are derived from the functions of our #[[fcef5cb9]]. Neural networks are
fed with information trained to soon become autonomous with making particulars
decision. Similarly, we train ourselves to do specific activities over and over
until we become good at the activity that it even becomes second nature to us.

Maybe someday, when computer science and neurology are completely married, we
can expand our mental capacity not by making our brains bigger, but by expanding
our capacity to store habits, which would effectively enhance our memory
recollection and use less energy to retrieve and store information.
