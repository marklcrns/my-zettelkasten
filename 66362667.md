"Rewards are powerful because they satisfy #[[dbd97e83|cravings]]. But we're
often not conscious of the cravings that drive our behaviors."[^The Power of
Habit]

Once you've #[[cc255a3f|identified your habit loop]], the next step is to find
what gives you the urge to start being in the routine.

Do you eat chocolates because you are hungry? Or maybe you just want to get up
off your desk and have the chocolates as an excuse to socialize? Or maybe, you
are just board and wanted to do something?

To help you identify the means to your habit, write down what you see, feel, or
on your mind after doing your routine. A list of three things is enough to help
you remember what you've done during your activity to figure out what for.

Another way is to experiment with different routines to see if an alternative
satisfies your urge. This step is very important because 
#[[df8128c0|you cannot just force your habit to the side]] as there is a big
chance of relapse. For instance, when feel like getting up from your desk to
grab a snack, try to pick up some fruits instead. Then on the next day, instead
of eating, talk to a friend for a few minutes before going back to your desk. Or
maybe next time, just get a quick walk around the building to get some air.

Finally, after you finished your new routine, set an alarm for 15 minutes to see
if you still have the urge to leave your desk. If you don't, then you found an
alternative that satisfy the same reward, otherwise, don't be discouraged and
try to find another activity.

Once you have made it clear what your craving can be satisfied by a different
routine, the next step is to [[b8010b9f]]#
