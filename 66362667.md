"Rewards are powerful because they satisfy [[dbd97e83|cravings]]. But we're
often not conscious of the cravings that drive our behaviors."[^The Power of
Habit]

Once you've #[[cc255a3f|identified your habit loop]], the next step is to find
what gives you the urge to start being in the routine. Few examples are:

- Do I eat chocolates because I'm are hungry?
- Or maybe I just want to get up off my desk and have the chocolates as an
  excuse to socialize?
- Am I just bored and wanted to do something?

To help you identify the means to your habit, write down a list of three word
describing what you saw, felt during your routine, or what is on your mind while
doing. It will help you remember what you've done during your activity to figure
out what you are doing it for.

Another way is to experiment with different routines to see if an alternative
satisfies your urge. This is ideal because
[[df8128c0|you cannot just force your habit to the side]], as it will most
likely result in a disappointing relapse. For instance, when feel like getting
up from your desk to grab a snack, try to pick up some fruits instead. Then on
the next day, instead of eating, talk to a friend for a few minutes before going
back to your desk. Or maybe next time, just get a quick walk around the building
to get some air.

Finally, after you finished your new routine, set an alarm for 15 minutes to see
if you still have the urge to leave your desk. If you don't, then you found an
alternative that satisfy the same reward, otherwise, don't be discouraged and
try to find another activity.

Every habit is unique, and therefore requires a tailored approach to figure out
what drives your habit. But once you it is clear that your craving can be
satisfied by a different routine, next is [[b8010b9f]]#.
