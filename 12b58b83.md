Procrastination, in my dictionary, is lacking in motivation to do something that
causes postponement of tasks. Sometimes, even the things that we love doing or
the things that we know is good for us we postpone. Even the most industrious
and inspired person procrastinated at least once in their life. Why? As Mel
Robbins, an author, lawyer, television host, and a motivational speaker, says,
"motivation is bullshit". What we need is a strategic plan to combat our urge to
procrastinate and to convert our motivation into a habit.

- Plan for procrastination attacks by controlled indulging[^1]
  - "If you choosing pressure-release moments ahead of time... You are more likely to snap
    back faster"
- Pay close attention to how your resolve fades
- Meditation
- Make rewards more accessible[^2]
  - `Tempation bundling`. A concept from behavioral economics performed by Katy
   Milkman at the University of Pennsylvania which suggests that we bundle those
   that are good for us in the long run which those that feel good in the short
   run.
- Make the consequences more immediate
