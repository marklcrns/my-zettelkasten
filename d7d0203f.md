"When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but have very little
knowledge of each other."

**Why?**

- The only thing the subject knows about an observer is that it implements
 a certain interface (the Observer interface).
- We can add new observers at any time.
- We never need to modify the subject to add new types of observers.
- We can reuse subjects or observers independently of each other.
- Changes to either the subject or an observer will not affect the other.
