Neurotransmitters are the chemical messengers in our body that our
#[[85bc468a|brain]] releases. Their main function is to transmit signals from
nerve cells (neurons) to target cells such as our muscles, glands or other
nerves.

## Types of Neurotransmitters

- **Excitatory neurotransmitters** encourage a target cell to take action.
- **Inhibitory neurotransmitters** decrease the chances of the target cell
  taking action. In some cases, these neurotransmitters have a relaxation-like
  effect.
- **Modulatory neurotransmitters** can send messages to many neurons at the same
  time. They also communicate with other neurotransmitters.
