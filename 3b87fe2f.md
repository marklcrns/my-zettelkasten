- Future-Proof. Stored in a plain-text files (Markdown) and  dynamically managed
  by a zettelkasten application.[^1]
- Notes are connected via tags metadata.
- Unlike #[[a10a5041|Niklas' way]] of storing index cards, I write zettels a bit
  more informative and graphic for the benefit of other readers, and my
  forgetful self in the future, while staying within a chunk of 5 mintute read.
- Decoupled from text editors, making it easier to edit and migrate outside of
  developing environment.
