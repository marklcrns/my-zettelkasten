Put simply, [backward
induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_induction) is the process of
reasoning backwards in time, from the culmination of a problem or situation to
the very first move, to better formulate an optimal strategy.

[[d48a38e6|Dynamic programming]] uses backward induction as a main method for
solving the [[271e92b9|Bellman equation]]. In [[c5724d4a|game theory]], backward
induction is mainly used to compute [[e3e17e65|subgame perfect equilibira]] in
[[a90852c6|sequential game]].
