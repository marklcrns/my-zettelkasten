# Design Principle 3

#[[7.object_oriented_programming|OOP]] design principle

**"Favor composition over inheritance."**

Common mistake in OOP is that its tempting to overuse class inheritance for
everything. After all, OOP is all about inheritance and polymorphism for code
reuse. However, most of the time programmers maintain or refactor code more than
build the code base from scratch. You only build from scratch once but you
maintain the code base indefinitely, and having a flexible class structure is
better than having a rigid class hierarchy that is difficult to maintain and
improve.

Composition isolate parts of an entity without exposing the main class, allowing
the isolated parts to be modified without affecting other classes. In contrast,
inheritance does not come very well with modification as the derived classes
depend on the implementation of the parent class. It would be very time
consuming to refactor codes that are tightly knitted every time you make some
improvements or modifications.
