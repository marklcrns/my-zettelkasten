Every #[[b11c411a]] has their triggers to send our brain a message letting our
#[[fcef5cb9]] to take over. For instance, every month you drive home from work
to stop by at McDonalds to buy some fries. Calling it your cheatday.  That
cheatday once a month becomes twice a month. Twice a month becomes once a week.
Then once a week becomes twice a week. You promise to yourself to consume fast
foods as occasionally as you planned your diet, but sometimes you just can't
help it. Since it already became a habit, every time you drive home after work,
your brain decides whether to go straight to McDonalds or go to the gym. Driving
home was your **cue** or trigger. You park your car at McDonalds parking lot
similar to how you park your car outside the gym. Someone takes your order and
you order the same burger and fries combo you always have as if on
cue--**Routine**. Now you take a big bite out of your burger, that familiar yet
exhilarating burst of flavors in your mouth, grease dripping down the side of
your lips all the while fitting a french fry on whatever space you have left in
your mouth sometimes chomping it down like a carrot. Thinking, you deserve to
treat yourself every once in a while for working so hard, its time to "reward"
yourself. A once a month commitment turned into a habit, and potentially into
a lifestyle.

Habit loop has been very well used and studied for many applications: Dietary
regimen, sports, advertising, etc. The book, The Power of Habit, tells different
ways habit loop has been adopted by many advertiseres that made them very
wealthy in the process. The key to creating a strong habit outlined in the book,
was to create an obvious cue and clearly define the reward. Having an obvious
recurring cue is like having a biological alarm clock that tells us to do
specific things at specific moment, to achieve a certain goal--the reward.
