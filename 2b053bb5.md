Does our personality acts as an anchor which we cannot get too far away from?
#[[eb55204d|Is our temperament fixed]] that even with the greatest of effort we
cannot change and will keep pulling us back to our center the harder we try? Or,
on the other hand, does our personality traits shift according to the situation
in which we find ourselves in? Perhaps quiet around family members and a comic
with the company of friends? Psychologist call this the "person-situation"
debate.

Professor Brian Little, former Harvard University psychology lecturer and winner
for the 3M Teaching Fellowship, despite his brilliant and engaging lectures with
a flair for entertainment that always ended with a hearty applause, he calls
himself a devout introvert. Professor Little believes that our personality shape
our lives in profound ways based on psychological mechanisms that last our
lifetime. This fall squarely on the "person" side of the debate.

On the other side, a group of psychologist known as the _Situationist_.
"Situationism posits that our generalizations about people, including the words
we use to describe one another--shy, agressive, conscientious, agreeable--are
misleading. There is no core self; there are only the various selves of
Situations X, Y, Z," wrote Susan Cain.[^1]

  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p>
    "A man has as many social selves as there are distinct groups of persons
    about whose opinion he cares. He generally shows a different side of himself
    to each of these different groups."
    - William James
