Does our #[[152e55d5|temperament]] act as
[[eb55204d|an anchor that we cannot get too far away from]], even with the
greatest of effort to change it will only pull us back to our base personality
no matter how hard we try? Or, on the other hand, does our personality traits
shift according to the situation in which we find ourselves in? Perhaps a quiet
disposition around family members but a comic around the company of friends?
Psychologists call this the "person-situation" debate.[^1]

Professor Brian Little, former Harvard University psychology lecturer and winner
for the 3M Teaching Fellowship, despite his brilliant and engaging lectures with
a flair for entertainment that always ended with a hearty applause, he calls
himself a devout introvert. Little believes that our personality shape our lives
in profound ways based on psychological mechanisms that last our lifetime. This
fall squarely on the "person" side of the debate.

On the other side of the debate, a group of psychologist known as the
_Situationist_. "Situationism posits that our generalizations about people,
including the words we use to describe one another--shy, aggressive,
conscientious, agreeable--are misleading. There is no core self; there are only
the various selves of Situations X, Y, Z," wrote Susan Cain.[^2] This view of
personality rose to popularity in 1968 when Walter Mischel Published
_Personality and Assessment_[^3], rivaling the idea of the "person" side of the
debate arguing that situational factors predicts behavior of people more
accurately.

Decades after the debate has been raised, Situationism prevailed. "The
postmodern view of self that emerged around this time, influenced by theorist
like Erving Goffman, author of _The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life_[^4],
suggested that social life is a performance and social masks are our true
selves," Cain explains, "Many researchers doubted whether personality traits
even existed in any meaningful sense. Personality researchers had trouble
finding jobs."

In the end, just as the [[152e55d5|nature-nurture]] debate melted down to
interactionism[^5], person-situation debate has been superseded by a more
nuanced understanding. Personality psychologists accepted that fluctuations in
our behavior are real and situation-dependent, while making aware that there
truly are fixed personality traits each of us cannot escape from.

Even Mischel admitted that some traits are fixed, but believed that they tend to
occur in patterns. Brian Little tend to posit the same claim as he almost
created single-handedly the [[1ba9c585|Free Trait Theory]]#, claiming that fixed
traits and free traits coexist.

  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p>
    "A man has as many social selves as there are distinct groups of persons
    about whose opinion he cares. He generally shows a different side of himself
    to each of these different groups."
    - William James
