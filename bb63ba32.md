The final step of #[[c9edab1b]], is to establish a plan of action to begin to
shift your behavior.

The hardest part of of #[[df8128c0|habit change]], even 
#[[b8010b9f|equipped with the knowledge of your cue]], is making the conscious
effort to steer away from doing your #[[cc255a3f|routine]]. Sometimes you forget
and sometimes you just don't have the #[[e0b74e7d]] to defy your urge. Hence,
study after study concluded that having a plan is the easiest way to accomplish
something. Not just having a plan in mind, it's as if writing in water, but
having it in a piece of paper is more powerful.

Say, through #[[66362667|reward experimentations]], your finding indicates you
quench your to urge to eat something sweet by eating a chocolate bar.  Also, you
found out that a #[[cc255a3f|working alternative]] is to bite an apple instead.
Your plan of action should be: "Whenever I feel the need to take a chocolate
bar, I will grab an apple instead." Or better yet, if you know what time you
usually snack, "At 4:30, I will go to the cafeteria and grab a fruit".

Specificity is key. The more you are specific with your plan, the easier it is
to follow.

Additionally, plan ahead for when you succumbed to your urge. After all, we are
just humans who act according to our urges. It's how we survive. You may choose
to punish yourself for it, better yet have a plan of action when you capitulate.
For instance, instead of eating a fruit you grabbed a cookie. You may write
"When I grabbed a cookie, I will only eat half of it." Still, you satisfied your
cue to eat something sweet but its still a #[[1723e0ed|win]] because you
resisted to eat the whole thing and abided by your plan.

You may a few more rules to your list, but make it simple, concise, actionable
and specific. Too complicated of a plan, and you might be overwhelmed. Too
simple, and you might ignore it.
