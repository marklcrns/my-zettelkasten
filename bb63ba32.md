The final step of #[[c9edab1b]], is to establish a plan of action to begin to
shift your behavior.

The hardest part of [[df8128c0|habit change]], even
[[b8010b9f|equipped with the knowledge of your cue]], is making the conscious
effort to steer away from doing your [[cc255a3f|routine]]. Sometimes you forget
and sometimes you just don't have the [[e0b74e7d|willpower]] to defy your urge.
Hence, study after study concluded that having a plan is the easiest way to
accomplish something. Not just having a plan in mind, it's as if writing in
water, but having it in a piece of paper is more powerful.

Say, through [[66362667|reward experimentations]], your finding indicates you
quench your sweet tooth by eating a chocolate bar and a
[[cc255a3f|working alternative]] is to bite an apple instead. Your plan of
action should be: "Whenever I feel the need to take a chocolate bar, I will grab
an apple instead." Better, if you know what time you usually snack, "At 4:30,
I will go to the cafeteria and grab a fruit".

**Specificity is key. The more specific your are with your plan, the easier it
is to follow.**

Additionally, plan ahead for when you succumbed to your urges. After all, we are
creatures who act according to our urges. It's how we survive. You may choose to
punish yourself for it, better yet have a plan of action for when you
capitulate. Sometimes, you won't have enough [[e0b74e7d|willpower]] to stick to
your rule after a long day of work. For instance, instead of eating a fruit you
grabbed a cookie. You may write on your plan: "When I grabbed a cookie instead
of a fruit, I will only eat half of it." Still, you satisfied your cue to eat
something sweet but it's a [[1723e0ed|win]] nonetheless, because you resisted
to eat the whole thing and abided by your plan.

You may add a few more rules to your list, but be sure to make it simple,
concise, actionable and specific. Not too complicated of a plan to overwhelm
yourself, but not too simple that you might ignore it.
