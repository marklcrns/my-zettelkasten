Zettelkasten, a German word for "slip-box", is a note-taking method and
a personal knowledge management used in research and study[^1]. The notes
contain _metadata_ for associating notes with each other, such as tags that
describe the key aspects of the note. Also, the notes are numbered
hierarchically so that new notes can be inserted in between under the
appropriate number:

```
1. Topic 1
  1.a Subtopic 1
  1.b Subtopic 2
    1.b.i Inner subtopic 1
    1.b.ii Inner subtopic 2
2. Topic 2
```

This method eliminates the need for dynamically organizing notes with folder
structures which can be time consuming and hard to make connections with. It
also makes it easier to draw connections and relationships that can be useful in
research and creative writing which otherwise would have been difficult with
other information management system.

Zettelkasten has been around since the 1500s and used by individual researchers
and organizations for managing information. However, it was popularized by the
sociologist Niklas Luhmann[^2] who built his own zettelkasten of some 90,000
index cards for his research which he claimed to be his secret for
extraordinarily writing over 70 books and 400 scholarly articles in his
lifetime. Luhmann linked the cards together by assigning each a unique index
number based on a branching hierarchy. The index cards were digitized and made
available online in 2019[^3].
