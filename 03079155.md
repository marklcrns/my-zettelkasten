In the beginning, the universe was hot and expanding, and was a mere cauldron
cooking matter-antimatter pairs in a battle for survival. Clashing against each
other, as matter creates, antimatter annihilates. As the universe began to
cool, matters very subtly outweighted antimatter leading to the creation of the
the universe as we know it. All this happend under $10^{-43}$ second of time.

Billion years later when the universe was cool enough, stars were formed and
underwent thermonuclear fusion. Some thrived but some exploded due to high-mass,
scattering their chemically rich bodies across the universe. Consequently,
galaxies, the Milky Way, and the Sun were born.

The gas clouds from which the Sun was created, formed planets that orbits around
it. Earth, not too far away and not too close from the Sun to freeze or to
evaporate the ocean, produced life in its primordial form. Bacteria. These
anaerobic organisms sets the Earth's environment by excreting enough oxygen for
aerobic organisms to live and breath in, and dominate the ocean and the surface
of the earth. Life began as we know it. Outsized dinosours dominate. Stray
asteroids hit the Earth, leading to the end of Cretaceous Periods. Intelligent
mammals flourished. Homo Sapiens thrived.
