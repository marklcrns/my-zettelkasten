"For an idea to grow beyond a community, it must become self-propelling. And
the surest way to achieve that is to give people new habits that help them
figure out where to go on their own" (The Power of Habit. ch.8).

"Movements don't emerge because everyone suddenly decides to face the same
direction at once. They rely on social patterns that begin as the habits of
friendship, grow through the #[[b11c411a]] of communities, and are sustained by
new habits that change participants' sense of self." (The Power of Habit. ch.8).

Social habits are one of the most powerful influences that can propel and ignite
activist movements or to change people's heart and perspective. The day Rosa
Park's was arrested, under the bus segregation law, in 1955 after refusing to
give up her seat for a white man, her outstanding reputation and vast
connections sparked the Montgomery bus boycott which led the Civil Rights Act of
1964 to be signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson--an act that would have been
considered a "political suicide" a decade earlier. Martin Luther King Jr.
preached peaceful protests, to offer the other cheek to the violence against the
black community. Peer pressure helped the movement grow and encourage the
community to participate, but would rather have died sooner had it not been for
the social habits King planted into the community. With King's guidance, new
leaders emerged to further the cause and to inspire other people. The movement
self-propelled.
