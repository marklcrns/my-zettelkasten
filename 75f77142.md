Discovered accidentally by John Gittins, statistics professor at Oxford, one of
the hardest mathematical riddle by solving an optimization problem for Unilever
corporation, a for-profit drug producing company.

In drug producing business, both the for-profit companies and the medical
profession they serve are faced with the dilemma of the
[[04f52b1f|explore/exploit trade-off]]. Companies want to make as much profit as
possible but also want to reinvest profits into R & D for new drug breakthrough.
Similarly, doctors are bound by their oath to "do no harm" and provide the best
treatment to their patients but also favors experimental studies that may save
countless number of lives in the future. However, the present holds more weight
into the equation and "a cured patient today is taken to be more valuable than
one cured a week or a year from now, and certainly the same holds true of
profits."[^1] In parlance of the economists, valuing the present more highly
then the future is called "discounting."

Gittins discovered what he called "dynamic allocation index", or more famously
the Gittins index, that also put to rest the long overdue
[[1f59b2e1|multi-armed bandit riddle]] with geometrically discounted
payoffs.[^2] The competing demand to explore or exploit dissolves into
maximization of a single quantity that accounts for both.

[^2]: _Geometric discounting_ refers to each decision to explore is worth
      a constant fraction of the last one.
