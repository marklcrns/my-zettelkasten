Discovered accidentally by John Gittins, statistics professor at Oxford, one of
the hardest mathematical riddle by solving an optimization problem for Unilever
corporation, a for-profit drug producing company.

In drug producing business, both the for-profit companies and the medical
profession they serve are faced with the dilemma of the
[[04f52b1f|explore/exploit trade-off]]. Companies want to make as much profit as
possible but also want to reinvest profits into R & D for new drug breakthrough.
Similarly, doctors are bound by their oath to "do no harm" and provide the best
treatment to their patients but also favors experimental studies that may save
countless number of lives in the future. However, the present holds more weight
into the equation and "a cured patient today is taken to be more valuable than
one cured a week or a year from now, and certainly the same holds true of
profits."[^1] In parlance of the economists, valuing the present more highly
then the future is called "discounting."

Gittins discovered what he called "dynamic allocation index", or more famously
the Gittins index, that also put to rest the long overdue
[[1f59b2e1|multi-armed bandit riddle]] with geometrically discounted
payoffs.[^2] The competing demand to explore or exploit dissolves into
maximization of a single quantity that accounts for both.

Here, the rules are simple. Using the
[[1f59b2e1|Multi-armed bandit slot machine problem]], with a record of 0 win and
0 losses we start at column 0 and row 0 and each win we go to the right of the
table and each losses we go down. Gittins index follows a [[209fb824|Markov
model]], that is the future state depends only on the current state, and never
on the prior events. The table assumes that the next arm pull is worth 90% of
the payoff now (much like a discount), and notice that the Gittins index at the
start point is already $.7029$ or a 70% probability of payout. In other words,
Gittins index gives the benefit of the doubt to a fresh start with no payout
knowledge of the slot machine.

The index increases as we go the to right of the table and decrease as we go
down, suggesting that we should keep playing as long as the machine pays out.
However, losing does not necessarily we should move on to the next slot machine.
The question: "is a fresh start worth more than my next pull?" For instance,
a record of 4-1 with an index of $.7869$ or a 79% chance of payout, we compare
to our starting point of 70% chance of payout, we should chance another pull
since starting over is worth less than the current state. Winning another round
only increases our chances of success but losing favors more of starting over.
With a record of 4-2 with an index of $.6579$ or a 66% chance of payout, we are
better off moving on to the next machine.

Gittins index is generally difficult to calculate. For a more elaborate
formulation of the Gittins index, see the paper
[_Multi-Armed Bandits, Gittins Index, and It's Calculation_](http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~amahaj1/projects/bandits/book/2013-bandit-computations.pdf)
