#[[810c5d55]] design principle

**"Program to an interface, not an implementation."**

The very purpose of creating an interface is to abstract away the unimportant
details of implementation and to serve as the skeleton for the classes that
implements it. Programming to an interface creates structures to your code as
you write them and a great vantage point for others to understand the intent of
the implementing class at a higher and less distracting level.
