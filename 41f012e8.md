Some #[[7caa6044]] are so ingrained into the culture that the only way for
a reform is through a crisis. Any good leaders know that a crisis is the best
way to create habits that can #[[df8128c0|replace the existing ones]]. In 2000,
Rhode Island Hospital cultivates destructive organizational habits where it
harbors enmity between its doctors and nurses.  Nurses where treated unfairly
and without respect by some doctors which caused series of grave operational
accidents. One doctor insisted to proceed with the skull surgery for blood
cloth, disregarding the nurse's insistence for confirmation with furious
reprimand for his authority, the doctor committed the location of the blood
cloth to memory and ended up operating on the wrong side that later caused the
patients death. Not long after, similar incident happended with a child being
operated on the wrong part of the child's mouth during a cleft palate surgery.
Another report from the hospital was a drill bit was left inside a man's head.

The Rhode Island Hospital paid expensive fines for their surgeons humiliating
mistakes and failed leadership among its doctors and nurses. The bad publicity
and the series of accidents were the jolt that gave them the wake up call to
take some action and make drastic changes. Some doctors were fired, executives
were replaced, and enrolled nurses and doctors through intensive training
programs that taught teamwork and mutual respect among each other.

In 2009, Rhode Island Hospital experienced no wrong-site errors since its new
safety procedures were fully implemented. The hospital earned a Beacon award,
the most prestigious recognition of critical care nursing, and honors from the
American College of Surgeons for the quality of cancer care.
