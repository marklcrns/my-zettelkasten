"Psychologists often discuss the difference between 'temperament' and
'personality.' Temperament refers to inborn, biologically based behavioral and
emotional patterns that are observable in infancy and early childhood;
personality is the complex brew that emerges after cultural influence and
personal experience are thrown into the mix." pg.101[^1]

Jerome Kagan, one of the great developmental psychologists of the twentieth
century, conducted a study on five hundred four-month-old infants for Child
Development at Harvard, predicting, on the strength of forty-five-minute
evaluation, which babies were more likely to turn into introverts or extroverts.

Professor Kagan's studies found that high-reactive children grow up to be
introverts, while low-reactive children becomes extroverted adults.

"We are born with prepackaged temperaments that powerfully shape our adult
personalities." pg.105[^1]

"Heritability statistics derived from twin studies show that
introversion-extroversion is only 40 to 50 percent heritable." pg.108[^1]
