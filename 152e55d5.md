"Psychologists often discuss the difference between 'temperament' and
'personality.' Temperament refers to inborn, biologically based behavioral and
emotional patterns that are observable in infancy and early childhood;
personality is the complex brew that emerges after cultural influence and
personal experience are thrown into the mix."

Jerome Kagan, one of the great developmental psychologists of the twentieth
century, conducted a study on five hundred four-month-old infants for Child
Development at Harvard, predicting, on the strength of forty-five-minute
evaluation, which babies were more likely to turn into introverts or extroverts.

Professor Kagan's studies found that **high-reactive** children grow up to be
introverts who avoids risk and are in comfortable in their own self-controlled
environment, while **low-reactive** children becomes extroverted adults who are
risk takers and outgoing.

High- and low-reactive infants seems to be the opposite of what we expect from
what an introvert and extrovert adult act like. High-reactive infants are those
who react more robustly to new stimuli such as ballon popping, colorful visuals,
or music. On the other hand, low-reactive ones are those infants who does the
opposite and remain calm and quiet to new experiences.
