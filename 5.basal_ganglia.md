# Basal Ganglia

Our brain is one of the most fragile part of our body that constantly stores new
information and keep our most precious memory since our first glance in this
world. If we likened our brain to that of the structure of an onion, having
layers upon layers, the outer layer of our brain, from an evolutionary
standpoint, is the faculty that process new information. Deep inside the core,
is the basal ganglia which functions used to be unknown to scientists until
recently.

Basal ganglia controls our automatic behavior such as walking or breathing.
Repeated actions or behavior undergo the process called "chunking", our brain's
way of learning new #[[6.habits]]. As we process new information, our brain
requires more memory space to store new memory for recollection. Converting
routine activity into a concrete habit is one of our brains primal ability for
maximum efficiency. Executing habits require far lesser brain activity and
cognitive power than processing new information for the first few times.

Also, our basal ganglia, being the core of our brain, is the last to give up
when the rest of our memory shuts down. Its the reason why some diseases
prevents people to form new information longer than few seconds, as if they were
stuck in a particular time forever, still retain old habits and possibly form
new ones, as with the case with Eugene Pauly and Henry Molaison (The Power of
Habit: Chapter 1). Without our basil ganglia, we would never process even the
simplest of task such as recognizing facial expression for not knowing where to
focus our eyes on in a conversation.

Its amazing how our brain manages to process and store information that will be
recollected at the time we need them. Additionally, "chunking" our routine
activities into habits is astonishing, making way for more process intensive
tasks such as having a conversation while driving, or coming up with a maneuver
while guarding a basketball from an opponent. Having very little personal
knowledge about machine learning, I suppose, most of the functions of a neural
network are derived from the functions of our basal ganglia. Neural networks are
fed with information trained to soon become autonomous with making particulars
decision. Similarly, we train ourselves to do specific activities over and over
until we become good at the activity that it even becomes second nature to us.

Maybe someday, when computer science and neurology are completely married, we
can expand our mental capacity not by making our brains bigger, but by expanding
our capacity to store habits, which would effectively enhance our memory
recollection and use less energy to retreive and store information.
