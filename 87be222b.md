The concern about optimal stopping is not choosing the right thing, but when to
stop looking. Stopping too early you risk of leaving opportunities undiscovered,
while stopping too late, you hold out for opportunities that might never come.
Optimal stopping requires the right balance between the two. Luckily for us,
mathematicians have figured out a general solution for this:
[[5e0d94ac|The 37% Rule]]#

The "secretary problem", with its mysterious origin, first came in public on
February 1960 issue of _Scientific American_ in Martin Gardner's beloved column
on recreational mathematics. The problem: "Imagine you're interviewing a set of
applicants for a position as a secretary, and your goal is to maximize the
chance of hiring the single best applicant in the pool. While you have no idea
how to assign scores to individual applicants, you can easily judge which one
you prefer. (A mathematician might say you have access only to _ordinal_
numbers--the relative ranks of the applicants compared to each other--but not to
the _cardinal_ numbers, their ratings on some kind of general scale.) You
interview the applicants in random order, one at a time. You can decide to offer
the job to an applicant at any point and they are guaranteed to accept,
terminating the search. But if you over an applicant, deciding not to hie them,
they are gone forever."[^1]
