The concern about optimal stopping is not choosing the right thing, but when to
stop looking. Stopping too early you risk of leaving opportunities undiscovered,
while stopping too late, you hold out for opportunities that might never come.
Optimal stopping requires the right balance between the two. Luckily for us,
mathematicians have figured out a general solution for this:
[[5e0d94ac|The 37% Rule]]#

## The Secretary Problem

The "secretary problem"[^1], with its mysterious origin, first came in public on
February 1960 issue of _Scientific American_ in Martin Gardner's beloved column
on recreational mathematics. The problem: "Imagine you're interviewing a set of
applicants for a position as a secretary, and your goal is to maximize the
chance of hiring the single best applicant in the pool. While you have no idea
how to assign scores to individual applicants, you can easily judge which one
you prefer. (A mathematician might say you have access only to _ordinal_
numbers--the relative ranks of the applicants compared to each other--but not to
the _cardinal_ numbers, their ratings on some kind of general scale.) You
interview the applicants in random order, one at a time. You can decide to offer
the job to an applicant at any point and they are guaranteed to accept,
terminating the search. But if you over an applicant, deciding not to hire them,
they are gone forever."[^2]

Finding the best applicants while settling nothing for less gets complicated as
the number of applicants reviewed increase. By definition, in an applicant of
three, the first applicant is the best applicant reviewed so far as it is
incomparable. By settling on the first, you have 33.33% of choosing the best
applicant but with the goal of choosing the best one in mind, it would be
optimal to skip for the second one because then there is a 50/50 chance of
getting the best/worst than the first applicant--best probability we could ever
hope for. Using the same logic, our odds of picking the best one decreases as
the number of applicants increase, and as the number of applicants approach
$\inf$, the chance of getting the best one converge to approximately 
[[5e0d94ac|37%]]#

Using this strategy, optimal solution takes the form of the
**Look-Then-Leap-Rule**, where you "set a predetermined amount of time for
'looking'--that is, exploring your options, gathering data--in which you
categorically don't choose anyone, no matter how impressive. After that point,
you enter the 'leap' phase, prepared to instantly commit to anyone who outshines
the best applicant you saw in the look phase"[^2]. With the 37% rule, in 100
applicants, we reject the first 37 random applicants to build our ordinal
ranking then hire the first best applicant so far.

  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p>
    The concern about optimal stopping is not choosing the right thing, but when
    to stop looking. Stopping too early you risk of leaving opportunities
    undiscovered, while stopping too late, you hold out for opportunities that
    might never come. Optimal stopping requires the right balance between the
    two. The 37% Rule, mathematicvally, gives us an optimal stopping point of
    when to stop looking without leaving too much opportunity on the table.
