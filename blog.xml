He was later acquitted and was not held culpable arguing that he is not aware of his actions. The judge evidently knew he did not murdered his wife and even consoled him after the court was dismissed. On the other hand, Angie Bachmann, a pathological gambler, lost all her inheritance money after her parents died into gambling and took out a loan against her family’s house. She felt out of control of her life, which the casino company took advantaged of, that after inheriting almost 1 million dollars and with all the effort to stop gambling for years, she &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Cravings&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;cravings&#34;&gt;succumbed to her old habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and lost everything with a pile of debt. The casino company filed a lawsuit against her and she lost the case as the court deemed her responsible for her actions, despite of the same arguments her lawyer made as with Brian Thomas, that she had no control over her habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should Angie Bachmann be treated the same way Brian Thomas was forgiven of his out-of-control sleepwalking? Bachmann knew her gambling &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;2021-07-22T09:29&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;habits&#34;&gt;Habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; existed and therefore have the opportunity to take some conscious action. On the contrary, Thomas can never control something he is not aware of, and therefore should not be held culpable for any actions he made or will do while sleepwalking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we are aware of our habits, we are responsible for our habitual actions, good or bad. There are ways to deal with even the most irresistible habit, but it is up to us whether to capitulate to our urges or to &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Habit Change&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;habit-change&#34;&gt;fight our most primal instinct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Power of Habit&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Duhigg&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chapter 9: The Neurology of Free Will&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/are-we-responsible-for-our-habits"/></entry><entry><id>https://marklucernas.dev/the-three-m</id><title type="text">The Three M&#39;s</title><updated>2021-08-19T07:07</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The three M’s, the limits that you need to at least release one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mindset = The what.

His studies found that weak ties have more significant role in business setting. Asking a stranger to vouch for you for a position in a company rarely occur than asking a close friend. Granovetter studies found that casual acquaintances are just as likely to accept such requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to peer pressure and &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;2021-08-17T07:24&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;social-habits&#34;&gt;Social Habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, we are likely to help a friend of a friend for fear of being disliked by others who might be connected to the person asking for a favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sociologists examines how opinions move through communities and found that “weak-tie acquaintances are often as influential–if not more–than our close-tie friends.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, weak ties keeps us up-to-date with informational news such as an open position in a company or an advancement opportunity, because we talk more about personal sentiments with our close friends rather than about business. Granovetter wrote,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-none&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;Individuals with few weak ties will be deprived of information from distant
parts of the social system and will be confined to the provincial news and
views fot their close friends. This deprivation will not  only insulate them
from the latest ideas and fashions but may put them in a disadvantaged
position in the labor market, where advancement can depend...on knowing
about appropriate job openings at just the right time.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further more, weak ties helps explain how protests can grow from a small group of friends into a activist movement with difficult and dangerous undertaking, just as the &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Social Habits&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;social-habits&#34;&gt;civil rights movement in 1955 accomplished&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Power of Habit&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Duhigg&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chapter 8: Saddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/weak-ties"/></entry><entry><id>https://marklucernas.dev/social-habits</id><title type="text">Social Habits</title><updated>2021-08-17T07:24</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn18.picryl.com/photo/2019/10/07/civil-rights-march-on-washington-dc-wkl-9df620-1024.jpg&#34; title=&#34;image from Picryl (cc)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For an idea to grow beyond a community, it must become self-propelling. And the surest way to achieve that is to give people new habits that help them figure out where to go on their own” (The Power of Habit. ch.8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Movements don’t emerge because everyone suddenly decides to face the same direction at once. They rely on social patterns that begin as the habits of friendship, grow through the &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;2021-07-22T09:29&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;habits&#34;&gt;Habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of communities, and are sustained by new habits that change participants’ sense of self.” (The Power of Habit. ch.8).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social habits are one of the most powerful influences that can propel and ignite activist movements or to change people’s heart and perspective. The day Rosa Park’s was arrested, under the bus segregation law, in 1955 after refusing to give up her seat for a white man, her outstanding reputation and vast connections sparked the Montgomery bus boycott which led the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to be signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson–an act that would have been considered a “political suicide” a decade earlier. Martin Luther King Jr. preached peaceful protests, to offer the other cheek to the violence against the black community. Peer pressure helped the movement grow and encourage the community to participate, but would rather have died sooner had it not been for the social habits King planted into the community. With King’s guidance, new leaders emerged to further the cause and to inspire other people.
