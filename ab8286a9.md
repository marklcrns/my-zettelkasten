In the late 1960s, Hans Eysenck, an influential research psychologist,
hypothesized that we humans always seek "just right" levels of stimulation[^1].
Stimulation is the input from the outside world that our brain processes.
Sure enough, introverts prefer a quiet place with low level of stimulation.
While party-seeking extroverts chase more stimulations than their introverted
peers.
