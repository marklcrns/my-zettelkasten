Hans Eysenck, an influential research psychologist in the late 1960s,
hypothesized that we humans always seek "just right"--not too much, not too
little--levels of stimulation[^1]. Stimulation is the input from the outside
world that our brain processes. Eysenck also saw the connection between the two
#[[0ad97bc4|great personality trait]] and level of stimulation: introverts find
it optimally stimulating when they work alone in a quiet place, while the
party-seeking extroverts chase more stimulations and can be seen more often
socializing.
