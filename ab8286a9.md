Hans Eysenck, an influential research psychologist in the late 1960s,
hypothesized that we humans always seek "just right" levels of
stimulation[^1]--input from the outside world that our brain processes. Eysenck
saw the connection between [[0ad97bc4|the two great personality trait]] and
levels of stimulation: introverts find it optimally stimulating when they work
alone in a quiet place, while the party-seeking extroverts chase more
stimulations and can be seen more often socializing.

Eysenck believes that the difference between two personality traits can be found
in our #[[173a6570|Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS)]], part of our
brainstem that has ascending pathways to the [[4c4de390|cortex]] and connections
to other parts of the brain which contribute to our wakefulness and behavioral
arousal. Eysenck speculated that ARAS maintains the balance between over- and
under-arousal by controlling the amount of stimulation that goes into our brain:
introverts have wide open channels where excessive stimulations can flow,
causing them to feel overwhelmed, while extroverts have narrower channels making
them prone to under-arousal. "Over-arousal doesn't produce anxiety so much as
the sense that you can't think straight--that you've had enough and would like
to go home now. Under-arousal is something like cabin fever. Not enough is
happening: you feel itchy, restless, and sluggish, like you need to get out of
the house already," wrote Susan Cain[^1].

Understanding the underlying difference between introversion and extroversion,
we can arrive to a solution, in parlance of personality psychologists, the
"optimal levels of arousal", or as Cain puts it, the "sweet spots." An introvert
in a party with profuse amount of socializing may feel overwhelmed and seek
solace in a less stimulating environment, or a sweet spot. Conversely, an
introvert reading within the confines of the study room found him/herself to be
reading at a lower rate of speed and have been reading few sentences multiple
times may feel like getting out and hanging out with friends. Again, the sweet
spot or just the right amount of stimulation. The opposite can also be true for
extroverts who gets bored easily and find the company of others to be their the
right amount of stimulation, while being alone to be under-stimulating.

Knowing how to get into our optimal levels of arousal can also greatly improve
our lifestyle and was scientifically found to be healthy. People who are aware
of their sweet spots have the understanding to decide whether to stay in their
current employment or start their own business. It also encourage us that
#[[eb55204d|being ourselves]] has positive benefits than pretending to be
someone we are not, which can #[[f102f12a|leak]] and be mentally exhausting.
Also, evidence shows that sweet spots can have life-or-death consequences.
Recent study at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research suggests that introverts
function better then extroverts when sleep deprived, which is cortically
de-arousing condition. Drowsy extroverts behind the wheel may feel less alert
and careful with their surroundings. Conversely, introverts in a loud and noisy
traffic may feel overwhelmed which could impair their thinking.
