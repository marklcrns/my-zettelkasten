From the commercial TV ads, to our school system and to workplaces, our society
have always favored forwardness, spontaneity and the hail-fellow-well-met who
put themselves out in the world. While the more reserved individuals shy away of
their talents and overlooked at opportunities they would've had had they been
more "enthusiastic".

Parenting in 1950s believe that children who are quiet and solitary are
unacceptable and that gregariousness are ideal for both genders. The quiet kids
were singled-out as problem cases in school and were shunned for their solitary
and serious demeanor. The parents of these introverted children mean well and
were only preparing their kids for higher education and the "real world."

For instance, in the late 1940s, Harvard's provost Paul Buck declared that
"Harvard should reject the 'sensitive, neurotic' type and the intellectually
over-stimulated' in favor of boys of the 'healthy extrovert kind" wrote, Susan
Cain[^1]. 1950 Yale's president, Alfred Whitney Griswold, stated that Yalie was
not a "beetle-browed, highly specialized intellectual, but a well-rounded man."

Furthermore, shy types are considered maladjusted people. The latest version of
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) considers
_Glossophobia_--fear of public speaking--to be a disease if it interferes with
the job performance of the sufferer. "It's not enough to be able to sit at your
computer excited about a fantastic regression analysis if you're squeamish about
presenting those results to an executive group", said one senior manager at
Eastman Kodak. Ironically, its OK to be squeamish about doing regression
analysis if you are excited about giving speeches, as Cain pointed out.

Introverts have always been unfairly treated for their "unenthusiastic energy"
or that introversion are often seen in a negative light. There is roughly an
equal distribution of #[[0ad97bc4|both personality types]],
[[b1483a17|but how come extroverts always the desirable ones?]]# We can conclude
from the _theory of evolution_--the strong survive and the weak cease to
exist--that introverts have their own unique capabilities that put them
