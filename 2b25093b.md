Self-monitoring is what psychologists call the tendency of a pseudo-introvert or
-extrovert to act out of their comfort personality. However, we can only hide
behind our masks for so long that
#[[1ba9c585|we will eventually break out of character]], even
for a moment. This phenomenon is called [[f102f12a|behavioral leakage]]#,
"when our true selves seep out via unconscious body language," as Susan Cain
puts it[^1].

Self-monitors are adept at keeping in character, modifying their behaviors to
the social demands of the situation. **High self-monitors** are the social
butterflies that can blend in any company at a drop of a hat. In contrast, **low
self-monitors** base their behavior on their own internal compass, have smaller
collection of social masks to play in, making them less sensitive to social
cues.
