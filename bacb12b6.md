Research psychologist Anders Ericsson identified the key to exceptional
achievement is through _Deliberate Practice_. Only when you work in solitude,
never in groups, can you engage Deliberate Practice, in other words, be _in the
zone_.

Studies suggests that elite performers spend more time practicing alone than
those in their peers. Chess grandmasters typically spend five thousand hours,
almost five times as many as the average players, studying the game by
themselves in their first ten years of learning to play. College students who
studies alone learn more quickly than studying with their peers. Elite athletes
and musicians who outperform their peers by a huge gap spends unusual amount of
time in solitary practice.

Deliberate Practice requires intense concentration and deep motivation and
having people around you can be distracting. Studies have found that the simple
act of being interrupted is one of the biggest barriers to productivity. Also,
when practicing deliberately, it is imperative that you work on something that
is most challenging personally. "When you practice deliberately, you identify
the tasks or knowledge that are just out of reach, strive to upgrade your
performance, monitor your progress, and revise accordingly. Practice sessions
that fall short of this standard are not only less useful-- they're counter
productive. They reinforce existing cognitive mechanisms instead of improving
them", wrote Susan Cain on Deliberate Practice.[^1]

In business setting, evidences show that

reduces productivity and makes people sick, literally. Another study found that
people who take a quiet stroll through the woods learn far better than the
people who walk down busy city streets. The minds who created revolutionary
inventions such as Linux, Wikipedia, or Personal Computer spends more of their
time not with their colleagues collaborating, but their time working alone.
