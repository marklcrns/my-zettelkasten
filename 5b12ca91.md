The Threshold Rule is simply accepting a result immediately if and only if the
result is above a certain criterion.

Considering the #[[7c64a4d1]], in a #[[7607687c|complete information]] market,
by using the Threshold Rule, you immediately accept an applicant if he/she is
above a certain percentile.[^1]

Another great example is when rolling a die as explained in detail in this
post [[3b79c642]]#.
