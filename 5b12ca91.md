The Threshold Rule is simply accepting a result if and only if the result is
above a certain criterion.

Considering the #[[7c64a4d1]], in a #[[7607687c|complete information]] market,
by using the Threshold Rule, you immediately accept an applicant if he/she is
above a certain percentile.[^1]

A rudimentary application of the Threshold Rule is when rolling a die. A general
rule of thumb for solving optimal stopping problems is thinking backwards or
using #[[95485766|backward induction]]. In a maximum roll of 6 where there are
equal chances of rolling any face of the die at any given roll, let $k$ equals
to the remaining roll, starting from $k = 0$ where all retry are expended, there
is an average value of a die roll of 3.5 $((1+2+3+4+5+6)/6)$. Using the
Threshold Rule, on the last roll where $k = 1$, you should stop at any value
greater than 3.5 (4 or higher). At this point, there is a 50% chance of rolling
1, 2 or 3 and be better of chancing the final roll, and a 50% chance of rolling
4, 5, or 6 (an average of 5). Therefore, the average for $k = 1$ is 4.25
$((5.0 + 3.5)/2)$ and should only consider another roll at $k = 2$ when the die
rolled higher than the average of 4.5 (5 or 6).

Following the strategy, let $p(k)$ equals the average value of a roll at a given
remaining rolls $k$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
  p(0) &= \frac{(1+2+3+4+5+6)}{6} = 3.5 \\
  p(1) &= \frac{p(0)+\frac{(4+5+6)}{3}}{2} = 4.25 \\
  p(2) &= \frac{p(0)+p(1)+\frac{5+6}{2}}{3} = 4.42 \\
  p(3) &= \frac{p(0)+p(1)+p(2)+\frac{5+6}{2}}{4} = 4.42 \\
  p(4) &= \frac{p(0)+p(1)+p(2)+p(3)+\frac{5+6}{2}}{5} = 4.42 \\
  p(5) &= \frac{p(0)+p(1)+p(2)+p(3)+p(4)+\frac{5+6}{2}}{6} = 4.42 \\
\end{aligned} \\
\cdots
$$

The algorithm seems to converge to $p = 4.42$ as $k$ approaches $\infty$ as
early as $k = 2$. Therefore, with the algorithm and the Threshold Rule, keep
chancing for a better roll, except when luck gives you 6 early on of course,
until there are 2 remaining rolls left.
