Since our earliest attendance in school, we were forced to participate in groups
among our peers to work towards a common goal, in fact, working in groups, under
a good leader, is indeed very effective, hence the saying "teamwork makes the
dream work." The big however, is that sometimes our _herd mentality_--our
tendency to conform or behave as others in a group rather than as
individuals--is not as effective as we think it is, even, an impediment that
kills the very purpose of working as a team.

Alex Osborn, a legendary advertising man in the twentieth century, an author of
several books, co-founder of the advertising agency Batten, Barton, Durstine,
and Osborn (BBDO), invented the concept of brainstorming, a process in which the
members of a group contribute ideas in a nonjudgemental environment.

Osborn's Brainstorming Rules:

1. Don't judge or criticize ideas.
2. Be freewheeling. The wilder the idea, the better.
3. Go for quantity. The more ideas you have, the better.
4. Build on ideas of fellow group members.

"Osborn believed passionately that groups--once freed from the shackles of
social judgement--produced more and better ideas than did individuals working in
solitude," wrote Susan Cain[^1]. Osborn's brainstorming concept caught on quick
and were adopted by company leaders with enthusiasm.

However, Osborn's brainstorming theory doesn't actually work in most cases.
A study conducted in 1963 by Marvin Dunnette, a psychology professor at
University of Minnesota, found interesting findings on brainstorming.
Forty-eight research scientists and forty-eight advertising executives, male
employees of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (inventors of the Post-it), were
asked to participate in both solitary and group brainstorming sessions. Dunnette
divided each set of forty-eight into twelve groups of four and were given
a problem, difficulties of being born with an extra thumb, to brainstorm.
Another session, each man were also given the same problem to brainstorm on his
own. The results were surprising. Twenty-three of the twenty-four groups
produced more ideas when they were working in solitude than collaborating. Also,
the advertising executives did no better than the presumably introverted
research scientists.

Since Dunnette's experiment, forty years later, the same conclusion were found
by similar researches: performance worsen as the group size increase. The
"evidence suggests that business people must be insane to use brainstorming
groups...If you have talented and motivated people, they should be encouraged to
work alone when creativity or efficiency is the highest priority," wrote
organizational psychologist Adrian Furnham.

Osborn's Brainstorming Cons:

1. _Social loafing_. Some people let others do the work. Spectators.
2. _Production blocking_. Only one person can produce an idea at once, rendering
   others to sit passively, potentially killing originality, or worse,
   forgetting their own ideas.
3. _Evaluation apprehension_. The fear of looking stupid in front of one's
   peers.

"The one exception to this is online brainstorming," wrote Cain, "Groups
brainstorming electronically, when properly managed, not only do better than
individuals, research shows; the larger the group, the better it performs."

Furthermore, recent studies on open-plan offices suggests that it reduces
productivity and impairs memory, makes people sick, hostile, unmotivated, and
insecure. Another recent study found that people, after a quiet stroll through
the woods, learn far better than walking in a noisier environment such as busy
city street. Yet another study, if 38,000 knowledge workers across different
sectors, concluded that the simple act of being interrupted is one of thj
biggest barrier to productivity, stated Cain[^1]. Scientists already proved we
are incapable of multitasking or paying attention to more than one thing at
a time. What looks like multitasking is really just switching back and forth
between tasks--context switching--, which actually reduces productivity by up to
50% and mentally exhausting.

Words of advice from Stephen Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Computer:

```
Most inventors and engineers I've met are like me--they're shy and they live in
their heads. They're almost like artists. In face, the very best of them are
artists. And artists work best alone where they can control an intention's
design without a lot of other people designing it for marketing or some other
committee. I don't believe anything really revolutionary has been invented by
committee. If you're that rare engineer who's an inventor and also an artist,
I'm going to give you some advice that might be hard to take. That advice is:
Work alone. You're going to be best able to design revolutionary products and
features if you're working on your own. Not on a committee. Not on a team.
```
