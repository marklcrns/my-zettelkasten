  California, Berkley. pg. 74[^1]

  innovation"[^1]

- "Open-plan offices have been found to reduce productivity and impair
  memory pg.84[^1].
- Alex Osborn's group "brainstorming" doesn't actually work, except online
  pg.88[^1]

Osborn's Brainstorming Rules:

1. Don't judge or criticize ideas.
2. Be freewheeling. The wilder the idea, the better.
3. Go for quantity. The more ideas you have, the better.
4. Build on ideas of fellow group members.

Osborn's Brainstorming Cons:

1. _Social loafing_. Some people let others do the work. Spectators.
2. _Production blocking_. Only one person can produce an idea at once, rendering
   others to sit passively.
3. _Evaluation apprehension_. The fear of looking stupid in front of one's
   peers.

"Osborn's 'rules' of brainstorming were meant to neutralize this anxiety, but
studies show that the feat of public humiliation is a potent force." pg.90[^1]
