Since our earliest attendance in school, we were forced to participate in groups
among our peers to work towards a common goal, in fact, working in groups, under
a good leader, is indeed very effective, hence the saying "teamwork makes the
dream work." The big however, is that sometimes our _herd mentality_--our
tendency to conform or behave as others in a group rather than as
individuals--is not as effective as we think it is, even, an impediment that
kills the very purpose of working as a team.

The first reason why collaboration is ineffective, is because it bottlenecks
ideas. When a group is taking turn brainstorming, others who are waiting for
their turn to pitch in sits idly, running the risk of being influenced by the
ideas of those who took their turn, or worse, forget their own idea.

Words of advice from Stephen Wozniak, co-founder of Apple Computer:

```
Most inventors and engineers I've met are like me--they're shy and they live in
their heads. They're almost like artists. In face, the very best of them are
artists. And artists work best alone where they can control an intention's
design without a lot of other people designing it for marketing or some other
committee. I don't believe anything really revolutionary has been invented by
committee. If you're that rare engineer who's an inventor and also an artist,
I'm going to give you some advice that might be hard to take. That advice is:
Work alone. You're going to be best able to design revolutionary products and
features if you're working on your own. Not on a committee. Not on a team.
```

- Alex Osborn's group "brainstorming" doesn't actually work, except online
  pg.88[^1]

Osborn's Brainstorming Rules:

1. Don't judge or criticize ideas.
2. Be freewheeling. The wilder the idea, the better.
3. Go for quantity. The more ideas you have, the better.
4. Build on ideas of fellow group members.

Osborn's Brainstorming Cons:

1. _Social loafing_. Some people let others do the work. Spectators.
2. _Production blocking_. Only one person can produce an idea at once, rendering
   others to sit passively.
3. _Evaluation apprehension_. The fear of looking stupid in front of one's
   peers.

"Osborn's 'rules' of brainstorming were meant to neutralize this anxiety, but
studies show that the feat of public humiliation is a potent force." pg.90[^1]
