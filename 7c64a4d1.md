The "secretary problem"[^1] (aka marriage problem or dowry problem), with its
mysterious origin, first came in public on February 1960 issue of _Scientific
American_ in Martin Gardner's beloved column on recreational mathematics. The
problem: "Imagine you're interviewing a set of applicants for a position as
a secretary, and your goal is to maximize the chance of hiring the single best
applicant in the pool. While you have no idea how to assign scores to individual
applicants, you can easily judge which one you prefer. (A mathematician might
say you have access only to _ordinal_ numbers--the relative ranks of the
applicants compared to each other--but not to the _cardinal_ numbers, their
ratings on some kind of general scale.) You interview the applicants in random
order, one at a time. You can decide to offer the job to an applicant at any
point and they are guaranteed to accept, terminating the search. But if you pass
over an applicant, deciding not to hire them, they are gone forever."[^2]


## Solution

Secretary Problem at a glance:

1. There is one secretarial position available
2. The number $n$ of applicants is known.
3. The applicants are interviewed sequentially in random order, each order being
   equally likely.
4. It is assumed that you can rank all the applicants from best to worst without
   ties. The decision to accept or reject an applicant must be based only on the
   relative ranks of those applicants interviewed so far.
5. An applicant once rejected cannot be recalled.
6. You are very particular and will be satisfied with nothing but the very best.
   (That is, your payoff is 1 if you choose the best of the $n$ applicants and
   0 otherwise.)

### Simplest

First, we can interpret the pass-and-reject rule where $r$ is the number of
rejects for $r \ge 1$, interviewer rejects the first $r - 1$ applicants, and
then chooses the next best in the relative ranking. So, the probability,
$\phi_{n}(r)$, of choosing the best applicant for $r = 1$, and for $r > 1$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
   \phi_{n}(r) &= \sum_{i = r}^{n} P\text{(ith applicant is selected and is the best)} \\
   &= \sum_{i = r}^{n} P\text{(ith applicant is selected or ith applicant is the best)} \cdot P\text{(ith applicant is the best)} \\
   &= \left [ \sum_{i = 1}^{r - 1} 0 + \sum_{i = 1}^{n} P\left ( \text{the best of the first i - 1 applicants is in the first r - 1 applicants or ith applicant is the best} \right ) \right ] \cdot \frac{1}{n} \\
   &= \left [ \sum_{i = r}^{n} \frac{r - 1}{i - 1} \right ] \cdot \frac{1}{n} \\
   &= \frac{r - 1}{n} \sum_{i = r}^{n} \frac{1}{i - 1} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The sum does not include when the number of automatically rejected applicants is
$r = 1$, therefore, the only feasible solution to this is $\phi_{n}(1)
= \frac{1}{n}$. This sum is only valid if and only if the best applicant among
the first $i - 1$ applicants is among the first $r - 1$ applicants that were
rejected. Hence, the selected better candidate can be selected from $i - 1$
where $i > r$. Put simply, there has to be a better candidate after the rejected
ones, else, no candidate can be selected since the best one among all candidates
were already rejected and cannot be bested by the remaining non-rejects.

Integrating the sum letting $n$ tend to infinity, writing $x$ as the limit of
$\frac{r - 1}{n}$, using $t$ for $\frac{i - 1}{n}$ and $dt$ for $\frac{1}{n}$,
the sum can be approximated by the integral

$$
\phi_{n}(x) = x \int_{x}^{1} \frac{1}{t}\;dt = -x\ln(x)
$$

The value of $x$ that maximizes the equation can be found by setting the
derivative of $\phi_{n}(x)$ with respect to $x$ equal to zero,
$\frac{d}{dx}\phi_{n}(x) = 0$, then solving for $x$ we find that $x = 1/e
= 0.367879 \cdots$.

Thus, the optimal cutoff tends to $n/e$ as $n$ increases, and the best
applicant is selected with probability $1/e$.
