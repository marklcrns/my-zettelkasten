And someone who is the opposite of cool might seem anxious, weird, or easily overwhelmed, making them less desirable than their cool peers. The list goes on for the usage of the term ‚Äúcool‚Äù but what exactly does being cool actually mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, scientifically, being ‚Äúcool‚Äù has some dermatological truth to it. Among other personality trait tests, researchers used skin conductance to determine the physiological reaction of our body to various stimuli. Researchers recorded how much people sweat in response to noise, strong emotions, etc., and concluded that &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container cf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Temperament&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;temperament&#34;&gt;high-reactive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; introverts sweat more as compared to their &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container cf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Temperament&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;temperament&#34;&gt;low-reactive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; extrovert peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‚Äú[Extroverts‚Äô skin] is literally ‚Äòthicker,‚Äô more impervious to stimuli, cooler to touch. In fact, according to some of the scientists I spoke to, this is where our notion of being socially ‚Äòcool‚Äô comes from; the lower-reactive you are, the cooler your skin, the cooler you are,‚Äù wrote Susan Cain&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In common social gatherings, alcoholic drinks are almost always present, even required, to keep the edge off to help with social anxiety by lowering our levels of arousal, ‚Äúcooling‚Äù the attendees down. Similarly, wearing dark sunglasses, even when its not sunny, hides the dilation of our eyes and covers part of our facial expressions which has the effect on people that magically makes the wearer cooler. Another, the slang term wearing ‚Äúice‚Äù, which refers to expensive jewelries worn as an accessory such as chain necklace or ring, is not a coincidence that the term is related to coolness. As Cain puts it, ‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôve adopted dark glasses, relaxed body language, and alcohol as signifiers precisely because they camouflage signs of a nervous system on overdrive.‚Äù Early U.S. Astronauts consider having a low heart rate, which is related to low reactivity, as a status symbol. Lieutenant Colonel John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth and was a presidential candidate in 1984, was known by his comrades as having a super cool pulse rate during liftoff of only 110 beats per minute‚Äìjust above the normal heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, polygraphs, more commonly known as lie detector test, are partially skin conductance tests. They operate on the belief that lying causes people to feel anxious which triggers their skin to sweat uncontrollably. ‚ÄúIncidentally, sociopaths lie at the extreme end of this coolness barometer‚Äù, stated Cain, ‚Äúwith extremely low levels of arousal, skin conductance, and anxiety. There is some evidence that sociopaths have damaged amygdalae.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, the lack of coolness comes with a benefit. For instance, &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container cf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: The Science of Blushing&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;the-science-of-blushing&#34;&gt;blushing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after an embarrassing incident makes people look sincere, trustworthy and is more likely to be forgiven when they have done wrong. Conversely, having a nonchalant attitude might seem offensive to others or insensitive for lack of showing emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can‚Äôt Stop Talking by Susan Cain - Chapter 6: ‚ÄúFranklin Was A Politician, But Eleanor Spoke Out Of Conscience‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/why-extroverts-are-cool-and-why-introverts-are-not"/></entry><entry><id>https://marklucernas.dev/optimal-levels-of-stimulation</id><title type="text">Optimal Levels of Stimulation</title><updated>2021-10-15T07:18</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hans Eysenck, an influential research psychologist in the late 1960s, hypothesized that we humans always seek ‚Äújust right‚Äù levels of stimulation&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;‚Äìinput from the outside world that our brain processes. Eysenck saw the connection between &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container cf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: The Great Divide in Personality&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;the-great-divide-of-personality&#34;&gt;the two great personality trait&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and levels of stimulation: introverts find it optimally stimulating when they work alone in a quiet place, while the party-seeking extroverts chase more stimulations and can be seen more often socializing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eysenck believes that the difference between two personality traits can be found in our &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS)&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;ascending-reticular-activating-system&#34;&gt;Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, part of our brainstem that has ascending pathways to the &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container cf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Cerebral Cortex&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;cerebral-cortex&#34;&gt;cortex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and connections to other parts of the brain which contribute to our wakefulness and behavioral arousal. Eysenck speculated that ARAS maintains the balance between over- and under-arousal by controlling the amount of stimulation that goes into our brain: introverts have wide open channels where excessive stimulations can flow, causing them to feel overwhelmed, while extroverts have narrower channels making them prone to under-arousal. ‚ÄúOver-arousal doesn‚Äôt produce anxiety so much as the sense that you can‚Äôt think straight‚Äìthat you‚Äôve had enough and would like to go home now. Under-arousal is something like cabin fever. Not enough is happening: you feel itchy, restless, and sluggish, like you need to get out of the house already,‚Äù wrote Susan Cain&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the underlying difference between introversion and extroversion, we can arrive to a solution, in parlance of personality psychologists, the ‚Äúoptimal levels of arousal‚Äù, or as Cain puts it, the ‚Äúsweet spots.‚Äù An introvert in a party with profuse amount of socializing may feel overwhelmed and seek solace in a less stimulating environment, or a sweet spot. Conversely, an introvert reading within the confines of the study room found him/herself to be reading at a lower rate of speed and have been reading few sentences multiple times may feel like getting out and hanging out with friends. Again, the sweet spot or just the right amount of stimulation. The opposite can also be true for extroverts who gets bored easily and find the company of others to be their the right amount of stimulation, while being alone to be under-stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to get into our optimal levels of arousal can also greatly improve our lifestyle and was scientifically found to be healthy. People who are aware of their sweet spots have the understanding to decide whether to stay in their current employment or start their own business. It also encourage us that &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Is Temperament Destiny?&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;is-temperament-destiny&#34;&gt;being ourselves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has positive benefits than pretending to be someone we are not, which can &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Behavioral Leakage&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;behavioral-leakage&#34;&gt;leak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and be mentally exhausting. Also, evidence shows that sweet spots can have life-or-death consequences. Recent study at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research suggests that introverts function better then extroverts when sleep deprived, which is cortically de-arousing condition. Drowsy extroverts behind the wheel may feel less alert and careful with their surroundings. Conversely, introverts in a loud and noisy traffic may feel overwhelmed which could impair their thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can‚Äôt Stop Talking by Susan Cain - Chapter 5: Beyond Temperament&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;‚Ü©Ô∏é&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/optimal-levels-of-stimulation"/></entry><entry><id>https://marklucernas.dev/behavioral-leakage</id><title type="text">Behavioral Leakage</title><updated>2021-10-13T07:41</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Studies have found that introverts and extroverts can play the role of the other, but only to some extent. &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;2021-09-21T07:41&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;free-trait-theory&#34;&gt;Free-Trait-Theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; suggests that we are capable of acting out of our ‚Äúfixed traits‚Äù and self-represent ourselves for the things we deem important or valuable‚Äìour &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container cf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;2021-09-22T07:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;core-personal-projects&#34;&gt;Core Personal Projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;‚Äìwhich enhances our lives dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavioral leakage is a phenomenon in which our role playing, typically when an introvert acts extroverted or vice versa, abruptly break out of character showing his/her true self through unconscious body language.

Chess grandmasters typically spend five thousand hours, almost five times as many as the average players, studying the game by themselves in their first ten years of learning to play. College students who studies alone learn more quickly than studying with their peers. Elite athletes and musicians who outperform their peers by a huge gap spends unusual amount of time in solitary practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deliberate Practice requires intense concentration and deep motivation and having people around you can be distracting. Studies have found that the simple act of being interrupted is one of the biggest barriers to productivity. Also, when practicing deliberately, it is imperative that you work on something that is most challenging personally. ‚ÄúWhen you practice deliberately, you identify the tasks or knowledge that are just out of reach, strive to upgrade your performance, monitor your progress, and revise accordingly. Practice sessions that fall short of this standard are not only less useful‚Äì they‚Äôre counter productive. They reinforce existing cognitive mechanisms instead of improving them‚Äù, wrote Susan Cain on Deliberate Practice&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In business setting, evidences show that &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: When Collaboration Kills Creativity&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;when-collaboration-kills-creativity&#34;&gt;open-plan offices nullifies the efficacies of collaboration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
