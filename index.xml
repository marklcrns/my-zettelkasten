Often times, we give great emotional weight to our core personal projects that when asked “How things are going?” we may respond with a rehearsed answer, but our true response relates to how well stand we it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Little, a high &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Self-Monitoring&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;self-monitoring&#34;&gt;self-monitor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a consummate introvert who loves his students dearly, is only able to break out of character and passionately lecture like a performer because of his core personal projects: opening students’ mind and attending to their well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding your core personal projects can be quite difficult especially for &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container cf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Struggles of the Introverts in an Extroverted Society&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;struggles-of-the-introverts-in-an-extroverted-society&#34;&gt;introverts who have been living under extroverted ideals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Susan Cain, in her book&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, offers 3 steps on finding your own core personal projects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think back to what you loved doing as a child. How did you answer what you want to be when you grew up? Our unadulterated childhood whims may reveal our true desire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pay attention to the work you gravitate to. You may not like what you do with your current job, but we often do things as a means to our goal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, pay attention to what you envy. “Jealousy is an ugly emotion, but it tells the truth.” We desire the things we are envious of which may give away a hint to a suitable core personal project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Our core personal projects are the things we value and love the most. It
    improve our lives significantly and give great emotional weight to it.
    Free Trait theory suggests we are only able to pretend someone we are not if
    we work towards a core personal project.

Or, on the other hand, does our personality traits shift according to the situation in which we find ourselves in? Perhaps a quiet disposition around family members but a comic around the company of friends? Psychologists call this the “person-situation” debate.&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Brian Little, former Harvard University psychology lecturer and winner for the 3M Teaching Fellowship, despite his brilliant and engaging lectures with a flair for entertainment that always ended with a hearty applause, he calls himself a devout introvert. Little believes that our personality shape our lives in profound ways based on psychological mechanisms that last our lifetime. This fall squarely on the “person” side of the debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the debate, a group of psychologist known as the &lt;em&gt;Situationist&lt;/em&gt;. “Situationism posits that our generalizations about people, including the words we use to describe one another–shy, aggressive, conscientious, agreeable–are misleading. There is no core self; there are only the various selves of Situations X, Y, Z,” wrote Susan Cain.&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This view of personality rose to popularity in 1968 when Walter Mischel Published &lt;em&gt;Personality and Assessment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, rivaling the idea of the “person” side of the debate arguing that situational factors predicts behavior of people more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades after the debate has been raised, Situationism prevailed. “The postmodern view of self that emerged around this time, influenced by theorist like Erving Goffman, author of &lt;em&gt;The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, suggested that social life is a performance and social masks are our true selves,” Cain explains, “Many researchers doubted whether personality traits even existed in any meaningful sense. Personality researchers had trouble finding jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, just as the &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Temperament&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;temperament&#34;&gt;nature-nurture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; debate melted down to interactionism&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, person-situation debate has been superseded by a more nuanced understanding. Personality psychologists accepted that fluctuations in our behavior are real and situation-dependent, while making aware that there truly are fixed personality traits each of us cannot escape from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Mischel admitted that some traits are fixed, but believed that they tend to occur in patterns. Brian Little tend to posit the same claim as he almost created single-handedly the &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folge&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Free Trait Theory&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;free-trait-theory&#34;&gt;Free Trait Theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, claiming that fixed traits and free traits coexist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &#34;A man has as many social selves as there are distinct groups of persons
    about whose opinion he cares. He generally shows a different side of himself
    to each of these different groups.&#34;

In Western Culture, being soft is not an attribute of a person with power, in fact, it can even be seen as a weakness and a submissive trait. However, eastern cultures, such as the Asians have just the opposite view. Preston Ni, communications professor at Foothill College, defines soft power as “quiet persistence.” As Ni puts it “Aggressive power beats you up; soft power wins you over.” Soft power is what makes people rally not by dynamism but through conviction, and can change people’s lives not by charisma but through caring.&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahatma Ghandi, an introverted indian man who were constitutionally shy and reserved, shook the world in a gentle way and changed countless of people’s lives through passive resistance and &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Extrovert vs Introvert Leadership&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;extrovert-vs-introvert-leadership&#34;&gt;quiet leadership&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Once the young Ghandi learned to manage his shyness, but never really overcame it, he traveled to England to study law against the will of the leaders of his subcaste Modhi Bania. The members of the caste where forbidden to eat meat and thought it is impossible to abstain from meat in England. But Ghandi thought otherwise since he already devoted himself to his mother to abstain from meat, and therefore got himself excommunicated, even after his return from England several years later completely abstained from consuming meat. Being excommunicated meant prohibition to eat or drink at the homes of his fellow caste members, including his own family. His sister and in-laws offered to host him at their homes surreptitiously, but he turned them all down. He abode by the rules of his caste as he did not see fit to retaliate or protest against the leaders of the caste. Eventually, through his persistence and compliance, the subcaste relented and even helped him later in his political work, without expecting anything in return. He later wrote, “It is my conviction that all these good things are due to my non-resistance. Had I agitated for being admitted to the caste, had I attempted to divide it into more camps, had I provoked the castemen, they would surely have retaliated, and instead of steering clear of the storm, I should, on arrival from England, have found myself in whirlpool of agitation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, his quiet conviction did not bode well for his law career. He struggled to wade through discrimination and disbelief in his &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Temperament&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;temperament&#34;&gt;temperament&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a lawyer, even by his own friends and colleagues. They said he was weak and should have stood up for his belief but Ghandi saw the power “to appreciate the beauty of compromise.” His passivity, as the word &lt;em&gt;Satyagraha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; implies, was not weakness at all. “It meant focusing on an ultimate goal and refusing to divert energy to unnecessary skirmishes along the way. Restraint, Ghandi believed, was one of his greatest assets”, Susan Cain wrote.&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Later in his career, he became one of the greatest political and spiritual leaders that would receive the honor as the “father of the nation” in India with his efforts to lead the non-violent independence movement against British rule and an advocate of the civil rights of Indians in South Africa.&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;

On the other hand, extroverts are risk takers and &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Reward Sensitivity&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;reward-sensitivity&#34;&gt;reward-sensitive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; people who “act before thinking” to get where they want to be as quickly as possible. Of course, not everyone falls solely on either side of the spectrum. Some are partial to both categories while others lie smack dab in the middle. However, despite the &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container cf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Temperament&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;temperament&#34;&gt;temperamental&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; difference between the two &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container cf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: The Great Divide in Personality&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;the-great-divide-of-personality&#34;&gt;personality traits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, neither has superior intellect over the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistically speaking, according to IQ scores, the two types are equally intelligent. As the psychologist Gerald Matthews describes in his work, introverts think more carefully than extroverts. Extroverts approach problem-solving head-on, taking shortcuts along the way, trading accuracy for speed which makes it easier to commit mistakes, and giving up altogether when the task gets overwhelmingly frustrating. Conversely, introverts digest information thoroughly, better at &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Delayed Gratification&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;delayed-gratification&#34;&gt;delaying gratification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, takes more preparation than extroverts do which makes it easier to stick with problems longer.&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wise words from the world-renowned genius theoretical physicist, Albert Einstein: “It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    No. Statistically, IQ scores shows that the two types are equal in
    intellect. The difference lie only on temperament.
