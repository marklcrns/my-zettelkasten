Eysenck saw the connection between &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container cf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: The Great Divide in Personality&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;the-great-divide-of-personality&#34;&gt;the two great personality trait&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and levels of stimulation: introverts find it optimally stimulating when they work alone in a quiet place, while the party-seeking extroverts chase more stimulations and can be seen more often socializing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eysenck believes that the difference between two personality traits can be found in our &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS)&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;ascending-reticular-activating-system&#34;&gt;Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, part of our brainstem that has ascending pathways to the &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container cf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Cerebral Cortex&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;cerebral-cortex&#34;&gt;cortex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and connections to other parts of the brain which contribute to our wakefulness and behavioral arousal. Eysenck speculated that ARAS maintains the balance between over- and under-arousal by controlling the amount of stimulation that goes into our brain: introverts have wide open channels where excessive stimulations can flow, causing them to feel overwhelmed, while extroverts have narrower channels making them prone to under-arousal. “Over-arousal doesn’t produce anxiety so much as the sense that you can’t think straight–that you’ve had enough and would like to go home now. Under-arousal is something like cabin fever. Not enough is happening: you feel itchy, restless, and sluggish, like you need to get out of the house already,” wrote Susan Cain&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the underlying difference between introversion and extroversion, we can arrive to a solution, in parlance of personality psychologists, the “optimal levels of arousal”, or as Cain puts it, the “sweet spots.” An introvert in a party with profuse amount of socializing may feel overwhelmed and seek solace in a less stimulating environment, or a sweet spot. Conversely, an introvert reading within the confines of the study room found him/herself to be reading at a lower rate of speed and have been reading few sentences multiple times may feel like getting out and hanging out with friends. Again, the sweet spot or just the right amount of stimulation. The opposite can also be true for extroverts who gets bored easily and find the company of others to be their the right amount of stimulation, while being alone to be under-stimulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to get into our optimal levels of arousal can also greatly improve our lifestyle and was scientifically found to be healthy. People who are aware of their sweet spots have the understanding to decide whether to stay in their current employment or start their own business. It also encourage us that &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Is Temperament Destiny?&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;is-temperament-destiny&#34;&gt;being ourselves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has positive benefits than pretending to be someone we are not, which can &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Behavioral Leakage&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;behavioral-leakage&#34;&gt;leak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and be mentally exhausting. Also, evidence shows that sweet spots can have life-or-death consequences. Recent study at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research suggests that introverts function better then extroverts when sleep deprived, which is cortically de-arousing condition. Drowsy extroverts behind the wheel may feel less alert and careful with their surroundings. Conversely, introverts in a loud and noisy traffic may feel overwhelmed which could impair their thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking by Susan Cain - Chapter 5: Beyond Temperament&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/optimal-levels-of-stimulation"/></entry><entry><id>https://marklucernas.dev/behavioral-leakage</id><title type="text">Behavioral Leakage</title><updated>2021-10-13T07:41</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Studies have found that introverts and extroverts can play the role of the other, but only to some extent. &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;2021-09-21T07:41&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;free-trait-theory&#34;&gt;Free-Trait-Theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; suggests that we are capable of acting out of our “fixed traits” and self-represent ourselves for the things we deem important or valuable–our &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container cf&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;2021-09-22T07:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;core-personal-projects&#34;&gt;Core Personal Projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;–which enhances our lives dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behavioral leakage is a phenomenon in which our role playing, typically when an introvert acts extroverted or vice versa, abruptly break out of character showing his/her true self through unconscious body language.

Only when you work in solitude, never in groups, can you engage Deliberate Practice, in other words, be &lt;em&gt;in the zone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies suggests that elite performers spend more time practicing alone than those in their peers. Chess grandmasters typically spend five thousand hours, almost five times as many as the average players, studying the game by themselves in their first ten years of learning to play. College students who studies alone learn more quickly than studying with their peers. Elite athletes and musicians who outperform their peers by a huge gap spends unusual amount of time in solitary practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deliberate Practice requires intense concentration and deep motivation and having people around you can be distracting. Studies have found that the simple act of being interrupted is one of the biggest barriers to productivity. Also, when practicing deliberately, it is imperative that you work on something that is most challenging personally. “When you practice deliberately, you identify the tasks or knowledge that are just out of reach, strive to upgrade your performance, monitor your progress, and revise accordingly. Practice sessions that fall short of this standard are not only less useful– they’re counter productive. They reinforce existing cognitive mechanisms instead of improving them”, wrote Susan Cain on Deliberate Practice&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In business setting, evidences show that &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: When Collaboration Kills Creativity&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;when-collaboration-kills-creativity&#34;&gt;open-plan offices nullifies the efficacies of collaboration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. It reduces productivity and makes people sick, literally. Another study found that people who take a quiet stroll through the woods learn far better than the people who walk down busy city streets. The minds who created revolutionary inventions such as Linux, Wikipedia, or Personal Computer spends more of their time not with their colleagues collaborating, but their time working alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking by Susan Cain - Chapter 3: When Collaboration Kills Creativity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/deliberate-practice"/></entry><entry><id>https://marklucernas.dev/thoughts-on-basal-ganglia</id><title type="text">Thoughts on Basal Ganglia</title><updated>2021-10-07T07:34</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Its amazing how our brain manages to process and store information that will be recollected at the time we need them. Additionally, “chunking” our routine activities into habits is astonishing, making way for more process intensive tasks such as having a conversation while driving, or coming up with a maneuver while guarding a basketball from an opponent&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Having very little personal knowledge about machine learning, I suppose, most of the functions of a neural network are derived from the functions of our &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;2021-10-07T07:31&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;basal-ganglia&#34;&gt;Basal Ganglia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Neural networks are fed with information trained to soon become autonomous with making particulars decision. Similarly, we train ourselves to do specific activities over and over until we become good at the activity that it even becomes second nature to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe someday, when computer science and neurology are completely married, we can expand our mental capacity not by making our brains bigger, but by expanding our capacity to store habits, which would effectively enhance our memory recollection and use less energy to retrieve and store information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg - Chapter 1: The Habit Loop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/thoughts-on-basal-ganglia"/></entry><entry><id>https://marklucernas.dev/basal-ganglia</id><title type="text">Basal Ganglia</title><updated>2021-10-07T07:31</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;wide&#34; src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Basal_ganglia_and_related_structures_%282%29.svg&#34; title=&#34;image from Wikimedia (cc)&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our brain is one of the most fragile part of our body that constantly stores new information and keep our most precious memory since our first glance in this world. If we liken our brain to that of the structure of an onion, having layers upon layers, the outer layer of our brain, from an evolutionary standpoint, is the faculty that process new information. Deep inside the core, is the basal ganglia which was recently discovered of its actual functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basal ganglia controls our automatic behavior such as walking or breathing. Repeated actions or behavior undergo the process called “chunking”, our brain’s way of learning new &lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link-container folgeinv&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;zettel-link&#34; title=&#34;Zettel: Habits&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;user-select: none; color: gray&#34; title=&#34;Folgezettel&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;habits&#34;&gt;habits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. As we process new information, our brain requires more memory space to store new memory for recollection. Converting routine activity into a concrete habit is one of our brains primal ability for maximum efficiency. Executing habits require far lesser brain activity and cognitive power than processing new information for the first few times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, our basal ganglia, being the core of our brain, is the last to give up when the rest of our memory shuts down. Its the reason why some diseases prevents people to form new information longer than few seconds, as if they were stuck in a particular time forever, still retain old habits and possibly form new ones, as with the case with Eugene Pauly and Henry Molaison&lt;span data-nosnippet=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Without our basal ganglia, we would never process even the simplest of task such as recognizing facial expression for not knowing where to focus our eyes on in a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg - Chapter 1: The Habit Loop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link href="https://marklucernas.dev/basal-ganglia"/></entry></feed>
