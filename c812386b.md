Introvert-extrovert couples attracts each other and are said to fill each
other's weakness. However, both have very different style of handling conflict.
Introverts are more likely to avoid conflicts than their extroverted partner,
while extroverts are more confrontational and upfront with their fealings.
pg.230[^1]

Psychologist William Graziano, finds through his simulated footbal game
experiment, that introverts like people the meet in a friendly context while
extroverts prefer those they compete with.

Introverted patients prefer to be treated in a gentle manner and would work
longer, while extroverts are more compliant when treated with aggressive
language.

released--pg.233

  - Introverts enjoys a conversation more with extroverts than with another
    introverts and vice versa.

introversion-extroversion levels are not correlated with eithr agreeablebness or
enjoyment of intimacy. Introverts are just as likely as the next kid to seek
others' company, though often in smaller doses.
