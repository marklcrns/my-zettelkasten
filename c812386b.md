Introvert-extrovert couples are said to fill each other's weaknesses and are
attracted to each other. However, both have very different style of handling
conflict. While, introverts are more likely to avoid conflicts than their
extroverted partner, extroverts are more confrontational and upfront with their
feelings.

Psychologist William Graziano conducted an experiment of sixty-one male students
to play in a simulated football game. He divided the students into teams were
half the participants assigned to play a cooperative game and the other half
promotes competition between teams. Each participants were shown fabricated
biographical information about all the participants and were asked to rate how
one feel about the other players. The findings Graziano found about the
difference between introverts and extroverts were remarkable: introverts like
people more they meet in friendly context while extroverts prefer those they
compete with[^1].

Another study in which robots interacted with stroke patients during physical
rehabilitation produced very similar results. Introverted patients prefer to be
treated in a gentle manner and would work longer, while extroverts are more
compliant when treated with aggressive language.

  - Introverts enjoys a conversation more with extroverts than with another
    introverts and vice versa.

introversion-extroversion levels are not correlated with either agreeableness or
enjoyment of intimacy. Introverts are just as likely as the next kid to seek
others' company, though often in smaller doses.
