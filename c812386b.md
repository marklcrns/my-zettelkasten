Introvert-extrovert couples attracts each other and are said to fill each
other's weakness. However, both have very different style of handling conflict.
Introverts are more likely to avoid conflicts than their extroverted partner,
while extroverts are more confrontational and upfront with their fealings.
pg.230[^1]

Psychologist William Graziano, finds through his simulated footbal game
experiment, that introverts like people the meet in a friendly context while
extroverts prefer those they compete with.

Introverted patients prefer to be treated in a gentle manner and would work
longer, while extroverts are more compliant when treated with aggressive
language.
