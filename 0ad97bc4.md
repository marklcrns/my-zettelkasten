Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist who founded analytical psychology, distinguish
the great divide between two personalities--extroverts and introverts--our
sociaty has been geared towards extroversion ideals. In the
#[[afd5dec6|Culture of Personality]], we follow those who are confident and
assertive than those who are reticent and unassuming. Researchers estimates
50-70% that make up the population were extroverts, while 16-50% were
introverts. [^1]

- but people who are
  well rounded.

- sit at your computer excited about a fantastic
  regression analysis if you're squeamish about presenting those results to an
  executive group". But its OK to be squeamish about doing regression analysis
  if you are excited about giving speeches. [^2]
