Carl G. Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist who founded analytical psychology,
distinguish the great divide between two personalities--extroverts and
introverts--our society has been geared towards extroversion ideals. In the
#[[afd5dec6|Culture of Personality]], we follow those who are confident and
assertive than those who are reticent and unassuming. Researchers estimates
50-70% that make up the population are extroverts, whilst 16-50% were
introverts. [^1]

Of course, personality has different flavors; its not always yin and yang of
personality. If you take the The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test, there
are actually 16 types of personalities based on the theory of psychological
types explained by Jung [^2]. The purpose of this test is to make the type
theory accessible to individuals and groups, and to help individuals find their
a suitable profession for their type.

Although MBTI is a paid service and is restricted for use only to certified
professionals [^3], there is a free online personality test similar to MBTI that
is more accessible to anyone who desires to know their type [^4].
