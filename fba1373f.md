Some of the first things that comes to mind to most of us when we think of
leadership are gregariousness, solid people skill, electrifying speeches, life
of the party, etc., and that quite leadership is an oxymoron. It's only natural
that we require these traits from a good leader as our society
[[f716779e|leans toward extroverted ideals]]#. We strive to be the Steve Jobs or
Captain America of the world and less like Mahatma Ghandi or Rosa Parks.

A research from a management professor at Wharton who consulted Fortune 500
executives and military leaders, Adam Grant, dug deeper into the correlation
between extroversion and leadership and found that the existing research failed
to differentiate among situations what leaders might face. Grant noticed that
existing studies focused more on what our perception of a good leader rooting
from our societal ideals rather than the actual result. Grant believes that
certain organization or context calls for an introverted leadership rather than
an extroverted approach.

His hypothesis was that extroverted leaders are better suited to lead passive
followers, and introverted leaders are more effective with proactive team.
"Introverts are uniquely good at leading initiative-takers. Because of their
inclination to listen to others and lack of interest in dominating social
situations", says Adam Grant, "...Having benefited from the talents of their
followers, they are likely to motivate them to be even more proactive." On the
other hand, extroverts "can be so intent on putting their own stamp on events
that they risk losing others' good ideas along the way and allowing [followers]
to lapse into passivity[^1]", wrote Susan Cain. However, extrovert's natural
ability to inspire are more effective on getting things done form passive
followers.

In conclusion, Grant's research suggest that introverted leaders are well suited
to just stick with what they do naturally and should not be construed as
anything less of a what we think a leader should be. In contrast, extroverts
"may wish to adopt a more reserved, quiet style," Grant writes, and should learn
to listen more to give the quite-oriented the chance to speak.
