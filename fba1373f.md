- Research suggests that introverted leaders are better suited to lead proactive
  team and extroverted leaders to passive followers.

"Introverts are uniquely good at leading initiative-takers. Because of their
inclination to listen to others and lack of interest in dominating social
situations...Having benefited from the talents of their followers, they are
likely to motivate them to be even more proactive." Adam Grant, Wharton
Management Professor.

Meanwhile, extroverts "can be so intent on putting their own stamp on events
that they risk losing others' good ideas along the way and allowing [followers]
to lapse into passivity." [^1]
