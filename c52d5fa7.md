In an attempt to simplify reward sensitivity, it is the measure of our
motivation to seek reward such as money, sex, or fame and influence. A highly
reward-sensitive person can get so excited by the prospect of the reward that it
impairs good judgement and ignore obvious warning signals. While
a reward-insensitive person can get too careful that they miss out on
opportunities they should have taken. It is the [[8196c931|trade-off]] that
separates the #[[0ad97bc4|two great personality trait]] from each other.

Dr. Janice Dorn, who has a PhD in neuroscience specializing brain anatomy, an MD
in psychiatry, an active trader, and a "financial psychiatrist" who has
counseled about six hundred traders, observed that her extroverted clients, on
average, are highly reward-sensitive, while the introverts are more conservative
that pay close attention to warning signals. "My introvert traders are much more
able to say 'OK, Janice, I do feel these excited emotions coming up in me, but
I understand that I can't act on them.' The introverts are much better at making
plan, staying with a plan, being very disciplined" said Dr. Dorn, wrote Susan
Cain.[^1]

Our #[[7aa4666c|limbic system]], which Dr. Dorn calls the "old brain" that we
share with the most primitive animals, is emotional and instinctive. It
comprises various structures such as our [[95875ab8|amygdala]], and it's highly
interconnected with the nucleus accumbens, brain's "pleasure center." According
to Dr. Dorn, it constantly tells us "Yes, yes, yes! Eat more, drink more, have
more sex, take lots of risk go for all the gusto you can get, and above all do
not think!". On the other hand, the "new brain" called the
#[[5fe4b67f|neocortex]], a part of our cerebral cortex, that is responsible for
thinking, planning, language, and decision-making, some of the very faculties
that makes us humans. It's job, as Dr. Dorn puts, is to tell us "No, no, no!
Don't do that because it's dangerous, makes no sense, and is not in your best
interests, or those of your family, or of society."

As we now know, extroverts are more sensitive to reward than introverts do. It's
what makes extroverts an extrovert. Richard Depue, a neurobiologist at Cornell
University, conducted an experiment where he gave amphetamine, an addictive drug
that activates the [[b2252c67|dopamine system]]--the "reward chemical", to
groups of introverts and extroverts. His experiments shown that extroverts had
stronger response and concluded that "introverts just don't buzz as easily".
Although the exact relationship between extroversion, dopamine, and the brain's
reward system has not been conclusively established, "extrovert's dopamine
pathway appears to be more active than those of introverts," wrote Cain.[^1]

Buzz is sometimes a good thing. It encourage us to work and play hard. But
sometimes, it pushes us to take risk that we shouldn't take. It cause us to
ignore warning signs we should be paying attention to. On the other hand, less
sensitivity to buzz can sometimes make us too conservative but it also shows
discipline for [[f2ab6c67|delayed gratification]], the
#[[6ba2f107|unique advantage of introverts in an extroverted society]].
