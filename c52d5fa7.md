- Extroverts are more sensitive to reward than introverts do. It's what makes
  extroverts an extrovert. Richard Depue, a neurobiologist at Cornell
  University, conducted an experiment where he gave amphetamine, a drug that
  activates the dopamine system, to groups of introverts and extroverts. His
  experiments shown that extroverts had stronger response and concluded that
  "introverts just don't buzz as easily" pg.160[^1]
- Limbic system, old brain, which is emotional and instictive that we share with
  most primitive mammals vs. Neocortex, new brain, "which is responsible for
  thinking, planning, language, and decision-making, some of the very faculties
  that makes us humans" pg.158
- Dopamine is the "reward chemical" pg.160 Cocaine and heroin are so
- addictive because it stimulate dopamine-releasing
  neurons in humans that make people euphiric.
- Buzz is sometimes a good thing. It encourage us to work and play hard. But
  sometimes, it pushes us to take risk that we shouldn't take. It cause us to
  ignoer warning signs. pg.161
