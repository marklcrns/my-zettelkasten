"One of the best things you can do for an introverted child is to work with him
on his reaction to novelty. Remember that introverts react not only to new
people, but also to new places and events. So don't mistake your child's caution
in new situations for inability to relate to others." pg.248p[^1]

The key is to expose your child gradually to new situations and people, while
letting your kid know that its natural to feel anxious and there is nothing to
be afraid of.

Stick around in the background with a gentle supporting hand on the back for as
long as your child seems to benefit from your presence.

- Reward or admire their efforts to take social risks.
- Acknowledge their fears while encouraging them to take small steps.

As Dr. Kenneth Rubin, the director of the Center for Children, Relationships and
Culture at the University of Maryland, writes, "If you're consistent in helping
your young child learn to regulate his or her emotions and behaviors in
soothing and supportive ways, something rathr magical will begin to happen: in
time, you might watch your daughter seem to be silently reassuring herself... He
or she is learning to self-regulate fearfulness and wariness." pg.249

Don't force your introverted child to socialize if they don't click with
a particular kid or their peers. You want most of their early social experiences
to be positive. As communications professor James McCroskey noted, "Forcing
highly apprehensive young people to perform orally is harmful. It will increase
apprehension and reduce self-esteem."

Arrange your child to enter social situations as gradually as possible. For
instance, having a talk with your child in advance what the party would be like
would help him rehearse his or her greatings, and also going in the party early
with be much easier for them as it would feel like they are joining him or her
company than breaking into a preexisting groups.
